<p class="indent">Good sir, or madam, whosoever thou mayest be, to whom this volume shall
come, cast it not aside, but read it. Its quaint, curious, and helpful
selections have been gathered through many years of careful research on
both sides of the Atlantic. They will make thee wiser and better, and
will conduce to the growth of thy mind, and the health of thy body. Let
this book be to thee a magazine of literary food, of which thou shalt
partake, and which thou shalt assimilate and digest to the constant
increase of thy well being.</p>

<p class="indent">The gathering of this bouquet of literary gems has been a work of
pleasure, but the compiler shall say nothing of himself for, "the least
that one can say of himself is still too much."</p>

<span class="i0">In man or woman, but far most in man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And most of all in man that ministers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And serves the altar, in my soul I loathe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All affectation. 'Tis my perfect scorn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Object of my implacable disgust.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What! Will a man play tricks, will he indulge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A silly fond conceit of his fair form<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a>[<a href="./images/12.png">12</a>]</span><span class="i0">And just proportion, fashionable mien,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pretty face, in presence of his God?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or will he seek to dazzle me with tropes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As with the diamond on his lily hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And play his brilliant parts before my eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I am hungry for the bread of life?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He mocks his Maker, prostitutes and shames<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His noble office, and, instead of truth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Displaying his own beauty, starves his flock.<br /></span>

<h4>THE APPROACH OF AGE.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Six years had passed, and forty ere the six,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When time began to play his usual tricks;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The locks once comely in a virgin's sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Locks of pure brown, displayed the encroaching white;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The blood, once fervid, now to cool began,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Time's strong pressure to subdue the man.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I rode or walked as I was wont before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now the bounding spirit was no more;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A moderate pace would now my body heat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A walk of moderate length distress my feet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I showed my stranger guest those hills sublime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But said, "The view is poor, we need not climb."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At a friend's mansion I began to dread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cold neat parlor and gay glazed bed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At home I felt a more decided taste,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a>[<a href="./images/14.png">14</a>]</span><span class="i0">And must have all things in my order placed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I ceased to hunt; my horses pleased me less&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My dinner more; I learned to play at chess.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I took my dog and gun, but saw the brute<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was disappointed that I did not shoot.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My morning walks I now could bear to lose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And blessed the shower that gave me not to choose.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In fact, I felt a languor stealing on;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The active arm, the agile hand, were gone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Small daily actions into habits grew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And new dislike to forms and fashions new.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I loved my trees in order to dispose;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I numbered peaches, looked how stocks arose;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Told the same story oft&mdash;in short, began to prose.<br /></span>

people." Such money, he thought, as distinct from that which is given,
was not wanted nor acceptable.</p>

was an impulsive girl, I was in a rage at my pony, and dismounting, beat
him severely. The old man stood by, silent for a moment.</p>

not seen?'</p>

<p class="indent">"<ins class="corr" title="single quote missing in original">'</ins>This horse is not my brother!<ins class="corr" title="original has double quote">'</ins> I said scornfully.</p>

<p class="indent">"The old man laid his hand on the brute's head and turned it toward me.
The eyes were full of terror.</p>

<p class="indent">"'Is not God his creator? Must He not care for him?' he said. 'Not a
sparrow falls to the ground without His notice.'</p>

<p class="indent">"I never forgot the lesson. It flashed on me then for the first time
that the dog that ran beside me, the birds, the very worms were His, and
I, too, was one of His great family."</p>

<p class="indent">Kindness to animals is no unworthy exercise of benevolence. We hold that
the life of brutes perishes with their breath, and that they are never
to be clothed again with consciousness. The inevitable shortness then of
their existence should plead for them touchingly. The insects on the
surface of the water, poor ephemeral things, who would needlessly
abridge their dancing pleasure of to-day? Such feelings we should have
towards the whole animate creation.</p>

<h4>APPEARANCES OFTEN MISUNDERSTOOD.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sometimes our estimate of men and women<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On short acquaintance is very much at fault.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">A gentleman and his wife&mdash;Pierrepont by name&mdash;passengers on one of the
great Atlantic steamers, not knowing any of the other passengers, kept
very much to themselves; he usually reading aloud to his wife, and she
occupied in some needle work; for this, they were commented upon, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a>[<a href="./images/24.png">24</a>]</span>and
not very favorably, and generally were called the "stupid couple."
Little did these same passengers know the true character of that
gentleman and lady. An incident that occurred on board soon proved the
bravery and heroism of the one, and the gentleness and self-sacrifice of
the other. The captain had with him his only son, a boy of some eight
summers, a great favorite of all on board from fore to aft. The little
fellow, climbing on the side of the ship, somehow fell overboard. The
lady happening to be on the other side of the deck, saw the child climb
up, and immediately missed him. She quickly laid her hand on her
husband's shoulder, looking in his eyes, and cried out, "Oh, save the
boy, he has fallen overboard." In one moment he was on his feet, kicked
off his canvas shoes, threw his hat on the deck, and turning his face
toward the bridge, where he knew some of the ship's officers were always
stationed, he called out in a voice which rang like a trumpet call over
the ship, "Man overboard." Then, with a quick run and leap, he cleared
the rail, and the broken twisting water of the ship's track had closed
over him. He was on the surface again in a moment, and taking a glance
back at the ship to know his position, stretched out into a long steady
stroke in the direction where he knew the child was.</p>

<p class="indent">Instantly the captain's hand was on the engine-room telegraph, and down
into the depths of the ship went the signals. First to "stop," and the
tremor all over the ship ceased. The bell rang again, and the index
moved to "astern-slow;" then in a minute or two, to, "half;" then he
called out to the second officer&mdash;"Man overboard! Stand by to lower away
the gig," which was quickly obeyed, and four hands, a coxswain, and a
man for the boat's bow were instantly off and rowed fiercely.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a>[<a href="./images/25.png">25</a>]</span>
In a little while Mrs. Pierrepont&mdash;who was on the bridge with Captain
Hood&mdash;said, "Do you see them; are they together?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes," replied the captain, "I believe they are." But his voice was now
broken, and he took hold of Mrs. Pierrepont's hand. "I have watched my
child from here with the glass, till at last he floated so low that I
could scarcely see him, and just as he seemed sinking your husband
dashed across the spot where he was, and I saw by a wave of his hand
towards the ship that he caught him. He is now waiting for the boat."</p>

<p class="indent">It was getting dark when they returned. The child, who was shivering,
was immediately carried away to have a warm bath, and a little later was
in the saloon with dry clothes on, as merry as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p class="indent">When Pierrepont stepped on the deck, a rush was made at him, and both
hands were shaken till he thought his arms would be pulled off.</p>

<p class="indent">The captain said all he had to say in a very few words, and with a
hand-grasp which said more than words.</p>

<h4>FACTS ABOUT THE BIBLE.</h4>

<p class="indent">The learned prince of Grenada, heir to the Spanish throne, imprisoned by
order of the Crown for fear he would aspire to the throne, was kept in
solitary confinement in the old prison at the Palace of Skulls, Madrid.
After thirty-three years in this living tomb, death came to his release,
and the following remarkable researches, taken from the Bible, and
marked with an old nail on the rough walls of his cell, told how the
brain sought employment through the weary years.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The 35th verse, 11th chapter of John, is the shortest.</p>

<p>The 9th verse of the 8th chapter of Esther is the longest.</p>

<p>The 8th verse of the 97th Psalm is the middle verse of the
Bible.</p>

<p>Each verse in Psalm 136 ends alike.</p>

<p>The 37th chapter of Isaiah and 19th chapter of 2d Kings are
alike.</p>

<p>The word "girl" occurs but once in the Bible, and that in
Joel, 3d chapter and 3d verse.</p>

<p>The word "Lord" is found 1853 times, the word "Jehovah" 6855
times, the word "reverend" but once, and that in Psalms 111th
chapter and 9th verse.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a>[<a href="./images/31.png">31</a>]</span>
The four most inspiring promises are in John, 14th chapter,
2d verse, 6th chapter and 37th verse; Matthew, 11th chapter
and 28th verse, and in Psalms, 37th chapter and 4th verse.</p>

<p>The finest chapter is in Acts, 26th.</p>

<h4>THE BIBLE.</h4>

<p class="indent">Who, coming to this sacred book, with a sincere desire to know God's
will for the direction of his life, will say that he can not find it?
Who, desiring to be instructed in the way of salvation "through faith
which is in Christ Jesus," will consult its pages, and say it is not
made plain to him? Who, coming to it for equipment of his spiritual
life, will say that there are still needs of that life which are left
unprovided for? Who, seeking direction in the way of the life
everlasting, can doubt that, if he faithfully obeys its teaching, he
will reach that goal? The Scripture fulfils the ends for which it was
given; no higher proof of its inspiration can be demanded. *&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*
What the closing verse of the 20th chapter of John's Gospel says of that
book: "But these are written, that ye may believe that Jesus is the
Christ, the Son of God, and that believing ye may have life through His
name," may with equal truth be applied to the Bible as a whole.</p>

<h4>BOOKS.</h4>

<p class="indent">The feeling that books are real friends is constantly present to all who
love reading. "I have friends," said Petrarch, "whose society is
extremely agreeable to me, they are of all ages, and of every country.
They have distinguished themselves both in the cabinet and in the field,
and obtained high honors for their knowledge of the sciences. It is easy
to gain access to them, for they are always at my service, and I admit
them to my company, and dismiss them from it, whenever I please. They
are never troublesome, but immediately answer every question I ask them.
Some relate to me the events of past ages, while others reveal to me the
secrets of Nature. Some teach me how to live, and others how to die.
Some, by their vivacity, drive away my cares and exhilarate my spirits;
while others give fortitude to my mind, and teach me the important
lesson how to deport myself, and to depend wholly on myself. They open
to me, in short, the various avenues of all the arts and sciences and
upon their information I may safely rely in all emergencies. In return

<h4>BOOKS.</h4>

<p class="indent">Books introduce us into the best society; they bring us into the
presence of the greatest minds that have ever lived. We hear what they
said and did; we see them as if they were really alive; we are
participators in their thoughts; we sympathize with them, enjoy with
them, grieve with them; their experience becomes ours, and we feel as if
we were in a measure actors with them in the scenes which they describe.</p>

<h4>BOOK-LENDING.</h4>

<p class="indent">Those who have collected books, and whose good nature has prompted them
to accommodate their friends with them, will feel the sting of the
answer made by a man of wit to one who lamented the difficulty which he
found in persuading his friends to return the volumes that he had lent
them:</p>

<p class="indent">"Sir," said he, "your acquaintances find, I suppose, that it is much
more easy to retain the books themselves, than what is contained in
them."</p>

<span class="i0i">Open a book upon a stall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">And read, as he'd devour it all;<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Which, when the stall-man did espy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Soon to the boy I heard him call,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"You, sir, you never buy a book,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Therefore in one you shall not look."<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a>[<a href="./images/37.png">37</a>]</span>
<span class="i0i">The boy passed slowly on, and with a sigh<br /></span>

that the late Henry Harland, the novelist, was seldom kept after school

<p class="indent">John Ruskin, in one of his lectures, said: "There is just this
difference between the making of a girl's character and a boy's: You may
chisel a boy into shape as you would a rock, or hammer him into it, if
he be of a better kind, as you would a piece of bronze; but you can not
hammer a girl into anything. She grows as a flower does&mdash;she will wither
without sun; she will decay in her sheath as a narcissus will if you do
not give her air enough; she must take her own fair form and way if she
take any, and in mind as in body, must have always&mdash;</p>

that you give their brothers; teach them, that courage and truth are the
pillars of their being.</p>

<p class="indent">Again: "The man's work for his own home, is to secure its maintenance,
progress, and defence; the woman's to secure its order, comfort, and
loveliness.</p>

<p class="indent">"What the man is at his own gate, defending it if need be, against
insult and spoil, that also, not in a less, but in a more devoted
measure, he is to be at the gate of his country, leaving his home, if
need be, even to the spoiler, to do his more incumbent work there.</p>

<p class="indent">"And in like manner what the woman is to be within her gates, as the
centre of order, the balm of distress, and the mirror of beauty, that
she is also to be without her gates, where order is more difficult,
distress more imminent, loveliness more rare."</p>

<h4>WHAT WE OWE TO ROBERT BURNS.</h4>

<p class="indent">Burns has been one of the world awakeners. His voice rang out of the
stillness, like the clear sweet notes of a bugle horn, and his songs
were sung with a nerve and strength of nature that stirred to its depths
the popular heart.</p>

<p class="indent">Describing Robert Burns' conversational gifts, Mr. Carlyle wrote: "They
were the theme of all that ever heard him. All kinds of gifts, from the
gracefullest allusions of courtesy to the highest fire of passionate
speech, loud floods of mirth, soft wailings of affection, laconic
emphasis, clear piercing insight, all were in him."</p>

<p class="indent">He awoke the poor and the despised to the dignity of man as man,
irrespective of the accidents of poverty or wealth.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The rank is but the guinea's stamp,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">The man's the man for a' that."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a>[<a href="./images/44.png">44</a>]</span>
Thus helping to deliver men from the debasing worship of sordid gold,
and of such rank as kings can confer on even the most worthless.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The man of independent mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">He looks and laughs at a' that."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">He opened the eyes of the Scottish people, at home and abroad, to the
glory of their nation's history, and glowing with the hope of a day&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"When man to man the world o'er<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Shall brithers be for a' that."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">He also opened men's eyes to the hatefulness of all shams and
hypocrisies; of meanness, selfishness and pride; of all narrowness and
greed and cruelty thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Man's inhumanity to man<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Makes countless thousands mourn."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">And again: He opened men's eyes to the cruelty and injustice of harsh
judgment, seen oftenest perhaps in people judging, or misjudging others,
who have yielded to temptations, or sunk under debasing influences, to
which they themselves have never been exposed. Where has Christian
charity and kindly consideration for others been more nobly taught than
in these lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Who made the heart, 'tis He alone<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Decidedly can try us;<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">He knows each chord, its various tone,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Each spring, its various bias.<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Then, at the balance, let's be mute,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We never can adjust it;<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">What's done we partly may compute,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But know not what's resisted."<br /></span>

<h4>LONDON MISSIONARY SOCIETY.</h4>

<p class="indent">Dr. Chalmers of Scotland, arrived in London, on the 13th of May, 1817,
and on the following day preached in Surrey Chapel, the anniversary
sermon for the London Missionary Society. Although the service did not
commence till eleven o'clock, at seven in the morning the chapel was
crowded to excess, and many thousands went off for want of room. He rose
and gave out his text from 1 Cor. xiv, 22-25. He had not proceeded many
minutes till his voice gradually expanded in strength and compass,
reaching every part of the house and commanding universal <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a>[<a href="./images/49.png">49</a>]</span>attention.
His sermon occupied about an hour and a half in the delivery. A
gentleman wrote to a friend: "I have just heard and witnessed the most
astonishing display of human talent that perhaps ever commanded hearing;
all my expectations were overwhelmed in the triumph of it."</p>

<p class="indent">At an afternoon service he preached in the Scotch Church, in Swallow
Street. On approaching the church, Dr. Chalmers and a friend found so
dense a mass within, and before the building, as to give no hope of
effecting an entrance by the mere force of ordinary pressure. Lifting
his cane and gently tapping the heads of those who were in advance, Dr.
Chalmers' friend exclaimed, "Make way there, make way please, for Dr.
Chalmers." The sturdy Londoners refused to move, believing it was a
ruse. Forced to retire, Dr. Chalmers retreated from the outskirts of the
crowd, crossed the street, stood for a few moments gazing on the growing
tumult, and had almost resolved altogether to withdraw, as access by any
of the ordinary entrances was impossible. At last a plank was projected
from one of the windows very near the pulpit, till it rested on an iron
palisade, and the Doctor and others gained entrance. The impression
produced by the service which followed, when all had at last settled
down into stillness, was deeper than that made by any of those which
preceded it.</p>

<p class="indent">In a village churchyard in England, there is the following epitaph. It
is there applied to a husband; but, by altering a single word, it can be

<h4>CHARACTER SHOULD NOT BE BELOW HOME STANDARD.</h4>

<p class="indent">Alexander Simpson, the elder brother of Sir James Simpson, watched over
the boyhood of the latter with parental care. When the social usages of
the town and the prevalent free mode of living presented strong
temptations to the boy, Alexander would put his arm round his neck and
tenderly warn him: "Others may do this, but it would break a' our hearts
and blast a' your prospects were ye to do it." After one such warning,
"Jamie was greatly troubled, and cried nearly a' the nicht (night) like
to break his heart." He obeyed the warning, and became a celebrated
physician in Edinburgh.</p>

they turn their backs upon it, or stamp in it with their feet, until the
water is polluted. This is the price they pay for their refreshing
draught. But what, then does the noble river? It immediately floats away
the mud, and continues after, as it was before, full and free of access
for the same or other thirsty creatures. And so must you also do. If
there be a fountain of genuine charity in your heart, it will
constantly, and spontaneously overflow, whether those who drink of it
are thankful or not. This life is the season for sowing and scattering;
we shall reap hereafter.</p>

<h4>INASMUCH.</h4>

<p class="indent">One day a little girl looking out of the window saw a number of poor men
from a nearby jail, working in the hot sun of a July day. They looked
tired and hot, and she knew they must be thirsty. She remembered
Christ's words, "I was thirsty and ye gave Me drink, was in prison, and
ye came unto Me," and the thought came to her, "I can do both." With her
mother's permission she took a little bucket of cold water, with a
dipper, and gave to each man in turn, refilling the bucket several
times. As she went from one to another in her white frock, her sweet
smile gave even better cheer than the water. The thanks of the prisoners
were very hearty. One asked her, "Little lady, what made you do this?"</p>

<p class="indent">After a moment's pause, she replied, "That is what Christ said to do,
and&mdash;I was sorry myself." He lowered his head and said, "God bless you,
little Christ-child."</p>

<h4>THE CHILD AND THE "RISING DAY"</h4>

<p class="indent">The following is a true narrative of an experience in life:</p>

<p class="indent">It was nearing three o'clock of last Easter afternoon, when a woman,
clad in deepest mourning, entered the gates of the beautiful "sleeping
place" on Walnut Hill. Her attitude, as she sank upon a carefully tended
mound, denoted deep dejection. She had not yet learned that the "tree of
death is fruited with the love of God," neither the joy of the
"afterward," but knew only the grope of a stricken soul.</p>

<p class="indent">In the distance, sat a child upon a grave, alone. Coming nearer, she
recognized him as one who had never known a mother, and whose father had
lately been taken, leaving him without kindred. The love between that
father and child had been passing sweet.</p>

<p class="indent">The bereaved lady knew this, and that he had been thrown homeless upon
the world. Yet, absorbed in her own grief, had given him little thought.
Drawing near, she observed closely the rare beauty of the boy, scarcely
five years of age, genius and nobility stamped on his brow, and
exquisite tenderness on the mobile lips.</p>

<p class="indent">He looked up eagerly, asking fearlessly, "Is your name Mary? Are you the
woman who talked with the angel when the stone was rolled away."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, no, dear," she replied. "Whom are you looking for?"</p>

<p class="indent">"For Jesus!" said the boy reverently.</p>

<p class="indent">"But he is not here. He is risen."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a>[<a href="./images/67.png">67</a>]</span>
"Yes, I know, that's it, but I've been waiting here all day for Him to
come and raise my papa up. He's late, and I thought maybe He sent you to
tell me to wait a little, just as He sent Mary to tell His disciples,
you know," said the boy, wistfully.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, dear, but"&mdash;hesitating to shatter the boy's beautiful faith.</p>

<p class="indent">"I am tired" (pathetically), "but it is never too late for Jesus," he
added bravely, while a tear rolled down the velvet cheek. "He is sure to
come, 'cause it is the Rising Day" (exultingly). "Don't you 'member?"</p>

<p class="indent">The woman stooped to kiss the child, and began to sob violently,
dropping on the grave beside him.</p>

<p class="indent">"What makes you cry, lady? Is your papa here to be raised up?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No, no, darling, but my sweet daughter is."</p>

<p class="indent">"Don't cry, then," stroking the lady's hand. "Jesus never goes by Rising
Day. He'll surely come and give you your little girl and me my papa!
He'll come to-night. I saw the two men who came from <a name="FNanchor_256:A_1" id="FNanchor_256:A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_256:A_1" class="fnanchor">[256:A]</a>Emmaus go by
early this morning, and they will be walking back soon in the evening,
and Jesus will meet them and turn and walk with them, and they will all
be talking gently about the dying and the rising, and the men will not
know Him, but I shall, and He will stop here when I call, and raise my
papa up."</p>

<p class="indent">"How will you know Him, dear boy?"</p>

<p class="indent">"By His smile and the Transfiguration picture that papa showed me in his
study. But I'll know Him bestest in here," putting his hand on his
breast, "by the love!" raising his lustrous eyes to hers.</p>

<p class="indent">"Will you know your papa? Are you sure?"</p>

<p class="indent">"My papa!" with wondering ecstatic voice. "My own papa! I shall know him
by the love, and you your little <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a>[<a href="./images/68.png">68</a>]</span>girl. They will not look the same,
'cause Jesus didn't, but they knew Him by their love!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes?"</p>

<p class="indent">"And we'll know them by our love!" lingering fondly on the repetition
with lustrous, far-seeing gaze.</p>

<p class="indent">The woman clasped the child to her breast with a passionate embrace,
while rising to meet a supreme hour. (The child must not&mdash;shall not be
disappointed and his beautiful faith shattered).</p>

<p class="indent">"Phillip!" she said, "listen. The angel sent me to tell you that Jesus
had gone into heaven, and to take you to your papa. Come!"</p>

<p class="indent">Without a moment's hesitation he took his messenger's (?) hand and
passed out of the gates, looking not backward by a glance. Expectation
held him silent, while the woman's face was illumined by a great light.
Entering the door of a pleasant house, she passed on through the hall
into the dining-room, saying to the maid: "Bring some food for this dear
child; he has fasted all day."</p>

<p class="indent">A pitcher of milk and a plate of bread and honey were set beside a plate
of cold, broiled fish.</p>

<p class="indent">"Now I know this is the house," the boy exclaimed exultingly, "for they
had the fish, the bread and the honey! It's all here, just the same, and
he'll come to-night!"</p>

<p class="indent">Turning swiftly to the hall, the woman almost flew along the corridor to
meet her husband's steps. Drawing him to one side, she told with rapture
of her encounter and the sweet expectancy below.</p>

<p class="indent">"Now, Harold, Heaven has sent us a child, who shall be the angel to roll
away the stone from our grave. His wonderful vision must not be
darkened, neither his faith destroyed. Rise, my husband, to the most
glorious hour of your life. 'I shall know him by the love,' he said. Let
us see that he does."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a>[<a href="./images/69.png">69</a>]</span>
Returning for the child and extending her hand with a smile, he eagerly
asked, "Will you wash and comb me to meet my papa? It isn't too late
yet, is it?"</p>

<p class="indent">The voice was half a sob, but full of hope. The ineffable trust pierced
her heart while reassuring him with swift, tender tones.</p>

<p class="indent">"Come, Phillip, we will go to him," she cried tremblingly.</p>

<p class="indent">As she opened the door upon a winning, noble-faced man with tears on his
cheek, smiling with outstretched arms upon the boy, he hesitated a
moment, took one step forward and then leaped into the open arms, threw
his noble head back, and gazed with lustrous, questioning eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">"You don't look like my papa, quite."</p>

<p class="indent">"No?" (anxiously).</p>

<p class="indent">"'Cause you are changed. But I know you by the love, and you know me,
don't you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"By the love, dear boy," with shining eyes, but marble lips.</p>

<p class="indent">The child nestled down upon the breast, his chest heaving, while the man
stroked the soft curls, soothing him with every word known to love's
alphabet, till finally, crooning a cradle song, the exhausted child fell
asleep. He had found a father by the love. His faith was saved, and by
it, she who had groped blindly among the tombs had found her Easter.</p>

<h4>WOULD YOU HAVE ANSWERED SO?</h4>

<p class="indent">You would not be in a Japanese house long without noticing their extreme
politeness, and that this politeness was especially shown by children
toward their parents. The one thing that Japanese children must learn is
perfect obedience; a child would as soon think of refusing to do a thing
altogether, when told, as to ask why he must do it.</p>

<p class="indent">A little *&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;* girl, the child of a missionary, was playing in the
street with some Japanese children.</p>

<p class="indent">"Mary," called her father from the house, "come in."</p>

<p class="indent">As she paid no attention, the others thought she had not heard, and
began to say to her: "Your august father is calling you," "Your
honorable parent is beckoning to you," and so on.</p>

<p class="indent">"I don't care," said Mary.</p>

<p class="indent">The children stopped playing and looked at her in astonishment. Her
father called her again. This time she answered crossly, "I don't want
to come in. What for?"</p>

<p class="indent">At this the children picked up their playthings and hurried home,
talking excitedly all the way. "Rude little foreigner!" "Bad little
girl!" they said, and it was a long time before Mary saw anything of her
friends again.</p>

childish footstep on the stairs, and her thoughts were instantly with
the favorite.</p>

<p class="indent">"No, mamma," was the sad, touching reply, "it isn't Sweet: it's only

<h4>DESCRIPTION OF THE PERSON OF JESUS CHRIST.</h4>

<p class="indent">The following description is alleged to be derived from an ancient
manuscript sent by Publius Lentellus, President of Judea, to the Senate
of Rome:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"There lives at this time in Judea, a man of singular
character, whose name is Jesus Christ. The barbarians esteem
Him as their prophet; but His followers adore Him as the
immediate offspring of the immortal God. He is endowed with
such unparalleled virtue as to call back the dead from their
graves and to heal every kind of disease with a word or a
touch. His person is tall and elegantly shaped; His aspect,
amiable and reverend; His hair flows in those beauteous shades
which no united colors can match, falling in graceful curls
below His ears, agreeably couching on His shoulders, and
parting on the crown of His head; His dress, that of the sect
of Nazarites; His forehead is smooth and large; His cheeks
without blemish, and of roseate hue; His nose and mouth are
formed with exquisite symmetry; His beard is thick and
suitable to the hair of His head, reaching a little below His
chin, and parting in the middle below; His eyes are clear,
bright, and serene.</p>

<p>"He rebukes with mildness, and invokes with the most tender
and persuasive language&mdash;His whole address, whether in word or
deed, being elegantly grave, and strictly characteristic of so
exalted a being. No man has seen Him laugh, but the whole
world beholds Him weep frequently, and so persuasive are His
tears that the whole multitude can not withhold their tears
from joining in sympathy with Him. He is moderate, temperate,
and wise; in short, whatever the phenomenon may turn out in
the end, He seems at present to be a man of excellent beauty
and Divine perfection, every way surpassing man."</p></div>

<p class="indent">As Henry Drummond, on board a government packet, was steaming away from
that group of islands known as the New Hebrides, after having visited
the missions there, he was asked by a fellow-passenger who had been
visiting the islands for a very different purpose, what good the
missionary had been to those people. "My dear young man," said Drummond,
"only for the missionary, you and I, instead of being in this cabin,
would probably by this time have been inside some of those savages, as
you call them, who waved us such an affectionate farewell from their
shores." Yes, Christianity is now recognized the world over, as foremost
among the moral forces that are civilizing the dark corners of the
earth. Even Matthew Arnold was forced to admit that there is no
civilization without it. "Show me," he said, "ten square miles outside
of Christianity where the life of man or woman is safe, and I'll throw
over Christianity at once."</p>

<h4>HOW THE CHURCH MUST GROW.</h4>

<p class="indent">It has seemed sometimes in recent years as if the deaths were more than
the births. This has brought home to the Church the absolute need of the
revival of religion if Christianity is not to perish from the world
which it has re-made. The Church is not an establishment in the world,
but an encampment. She has no natural increase. She lives only by
capture, by winning over from the world the citizens that make her
number. One must arm another with the Christian panoply, if the Church
is to continue.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Note:</span> <i>In Dr. Guthrie's Autobiography</i>, vol. I, page 125&mdash;Describing the
first church he became pastor of, in Arbirlot, in 1830, he says: "As to

<h4>LATE CHURCH-GOERS.</h4>

therefore, as they entered the place of worship at their usual late
hour, the minister, addressing his congregation, said: "But, my hearers,
it is time for us now to conclude, for here are our friends just come to
fetch us home."</p>

hit upon a way to put an end to this state of matters. Calling on
Macintosh, he said: "By the way, Mr. Macintosh, have you ever noticed
Mr. Macpherson sleeping during the sermon?" "Many a time," replied
Macintosh, virtuously. "Well, next Sunday you might sit beside
Macpherson and try and keep him awake." "I'll do that sir," said
Macintosh. Then the minister went to Macpherson and went through the
same programme concerning Macintosh.</p>

<p class="indent">Next Sunday it was highly amusing to those in the secret to see
Macintosh and Macpherson sitting next to each other, both perfectly wide

road. Ever afterward, in walking along, he kept his eye fixed steadily
upon the ground in hopes to find another. And in the course of a long
life he did pick up, at different times, a goodly number of coins, gold
and silver. But all these years, while he was looking for them, he saw
not that the heavens were bright above him, and nature beautiful around.
He never once allowed his eye to look up from the mud and filth in which
he sought his treasure; and when he died&mdash;a rich old man&mdash;he only knew
this fair earth as a dirty road to pick up money as you walk along. Thus
you see the desire of having is the sin of covetousness.</p>

shortly leave you." "And whither are you going?" said the fool. "Into
another world," replied his lordship. "And when will you come again?
Within a month?" "No." "Within a year?" "No." "When then?" "Never."
"Never!" said the fool, "and what provision hast thou made for thy
entertainment there, whither thou goest?" "None at all." "No!" said the
fool, "none at all! Here then, take my staff; for with all my folly, I
am not guilty of any such folly as this."</p>

<h4>RISE ABOVE YOUR DIFFICULTIES.</h4>

<p class="indent">Not till after the death of a member of Parliament, a prominent county
magistrate, the owner of large estates, and an active, public-spirited
man in all local and national matters, was it known by those who had not
seen him, that it was but the misshapen block of a man that had lived
this active, manly life.</p>

<p class="indent">He was born with neither legs nor arms. After his death his story was
told: how he resolved, when but a boy, to act and live as did other
boys, without regard to his horrible misfortune; how he persisted in
studying every book, in learning every game, in joining in every
amusement possible to him, with his companions. How, to the last year of
his life, he held himself to be as responsible as other men, and bravely
paid every tithe of duty to God and to his fellows.</p>

<p class="indent">Even in lesser matters in life he pressed to the front. He was the most
genial, witty guest at social dinner tables. Strapped to his horse, he
hunted foxes in Yorkshire, or tigers in India, and with his brothers
made long journeys in other parts of the world. Everywhere his
cheerfulness and gaiety gave new life to duller souls.</p>

A heathen king, who had been for years confirmed in the sin of
drunkenness by the evil practices of white men on the Sandwich Islands,
had been led to forsake the dreadful habit. He said lately to a
missionary, "suppose you put four thousand dollars in one hand, and a
glass of rum in the other; you say, you drink this rum, I give you four
thousand dollars, I no drink it; you say you kill me, I no drink it."</p>

<h4>THE RIGHT ANSWER.</h4>

<p class="indent">In an address to a temperance society, Admiral Capps told a story which
is printed in the New York <i>Tribune</i>.&mdash;A man who had ruined his health
with alcohol sat looking sadly at his wife, to whom he had made many
promises of reform.</p>

<p class="indent">"Jenny," he said, "you are a clever woman, a courageous, good woman. You
should have married a better man than I am."</p>

<p class="indent">She looked at him, thin-limbed and stoop-shouldered, prematurely old,
and answered, quietly, "I did, James."</p>

<p class="indent">A person in Maryland, who was addicted to drunkenness, hearing a
considerable uproar in his kitchen one night, felt the curiosity to step
without noise to the door, to know what was the matter; when he found
his servants indulging in the most unbounded roars of laughter at a
couple of negro boys, who were mimicking himself in his drunken
fits!&mdash;as how he reeled and staggered&mdash;how he looked and nodded&mdash;and
hiccupped and tumbled. The pictures which these children of nature drew
of him, and which had filled the rest with such inexhaustible merriment,
struck him with <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a>[<a href="./images/111.png">111</a>]</span>so salutary a disgust, that from that night he became a
perfectly sober man, to the great joy of his wife and children.</p>

<p class="indent">Pray tell me whence you derive the origin of the word dun? The true
origin of this expression owes its birth to one Joe Dunn, a famous
bailiff of the town of Lincoln, England, so extremely active, and so
dexterous at the management of his rough business, that it became a
proverb, when a man refused to pay his debts, "Why don't you Dun him?"
that is, why don't you send Dun to arrest him? Hence it grew a custom,
and is now as old as since the days of Henry VII.</p>

<h4>EXTERNAL SIGNS OF EMOTIONS AND PASSIONS.</h4>

<p class="indent">One would not imagine who has not given particular attention, that the
body should be susceptible to such variety of attitudes and emotions, as
readily to accompany every different emotion with a corresponding
expression. Humility for example, is expressed naturally by hanging the
head; arrogance, by its elevation; and languor or despondence, by
reclining it to one side. The expressions of the hands are manifold by
different attitudes and motions; they express desire, hope, fear; they
assist us in promising, in inviting, in keeping one at a distance; they
are made instruments of threatening, of supplication, of praise, and of
horror; they are employed in approving, in refusing, in questioning; in
showing our joy, our sorrow, our doubts, our regret, and our admiration.</p>

<h4>THE MOUNTAIN FLOWER.</h4>

<p class="indent">In Ross-shire, Scotland, there is an immense mountain gorge. The rocks
have been rent in twain, and set apart twenty feet, forming two
perpendicular walls two hundred feet in height. On either side of these
natural walls, in crevices where earth has collected, grow wild flowers
of rare quality and beauty. A company of tourists visiting that part of
the country were desirous to possess themselves of specimens of these
beautiful mountain flowers; but how to obtain them they knew not. At
length they thought they might be gathered by suspending a person over
the cliff by a rope. They offered a Highland boy, who was near by, a
handsome sum of money to undertake the difficult and dangerous task. The
boy looked down into the awful abyss that yawned below, and shrunk from
the undertaking; but the money was tempting. Could he confide in the
strangers? Could he venture his life in their hands? He felt that he
could not; but he thought of his father, and, looking once more at the
cliff, and then at the proffered reward, his eyes brightened, and he
exclaimed: "I'll go if my father holds the rope." Beautiful illustration
of the nature of faith.</p>

<h4>MAN AND THE FARM.</h4>

<p class="indent">It is a common complaint that the farm and farm life are not appreciated
by our people. We long for the more elegant pursuits, or the ways and
fashions, of the town. But the farmer has the most sane and natural
occupation, and ought to find it sweeter, if less highly seasoned, than
any other. He alone, strictly speaking, has a home. How many ties, how
many resources, he has!&mdash;his friendship with his cattle, his team, his
dog, his trees; the satisfaction in his growing crops, in his improved
fields; his intimacy with nature, with bird and beast, and with the
quickening elemental forces; his co-operations with the cloud, the sun,
the seasons, heat, wind, rain, frost. It humbles him, teaches him
patience and reverence. Cling to the farm, make much of it, put yourself
into it, bestow your heart and brain upon it.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">My father loved the patient angler's art,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many a summer's day, from early morn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To latest evening, by some streamlet's side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We two have tarried; strange companionship!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sad and silent man; a joyous child!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet those were days as I recall them now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Supremely happy. Silent though he was,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My father's eyes were often on his child<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tenderly eloquent&mdash;and his few words<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were kind and gentle. Never angry tone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Repulsed me if I broke upon his thoughts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With childish question. But I learned at last,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Learned intuitively to hold my peace.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the dark hour was on him, and deep sighs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spoke the perturbed spirit&mdash;only then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I crept a little closer to his side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stole my hand in his, or on his arm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laid my cheek softly: till the simple wile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Won on his sad abstraction, and he turned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a faint smile, and sighed and shook his head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stooping toward me; so I reached at last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mine arm about his neck and clasped it close,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Printing his pale brow with a silent kiss.<br /></span>

<p class="indent"><i>Love for a Father.</i>&mdash;In the year 1773, a gentleman in England, whose
health was rapidly declining, was advised by his physicians to go to Spa
for the recovery of his health. His <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a>[<a href="./images/125.png">125</a>]</span>daughters feared that those who had
only motives entirely mercenary would not pay him that attention which
he might expect from those who, from duty and affection united, would
feel the greatest pleasure in ministering to his ease and comfort; they,
therefore, resolved to accompany him. They proved that it was not a
spirit of dissipation and gaiety that led them to the springs, for they
were not to be seen in any of the gay and fashionable circles; they were
never out of their father's company, and never stirred from home, except
to attend him, either to take the air or drink the waters; in a word,
they lived a most recluse life in the midst of a town then the resort of
the most illustrious and fashionable personages of Europe. This
exemplary attention to their father procured these three amiable sisters
the admiration of all the visitors at Spa, and was the cause of their
elevation to that rank in life to which their merits gave them so just a
title. They were all married to noblemen: one to the Earl of Beverly,
another to the Duke of Hamilton, and a third to the Duke of
Northumberland. And it is justice to them to say that they reflected
honor on their rank, rather than derived any from it.</p>

<h4>SUPPOSE YOU TRY FORGIVENESS.</h4>

<p class="indent">The story is told of a British soldier who had broken every rule of the
army and on whom every form of punishment had been inflicted without
avail. He sinned again. His commanding officer was in despair as to what
should be done. A fellow officer said, "Suppose you try forgiveness."
The guilty soldier was summoned. On being asked what he had to say in
palliation of his offense, he hung his head and replied: "Nothing,
except I'm very sorry." "Well," said the officer, "We have decided to
forgive you." The culprit looked dazed, burst into tears, saluted, and
went out to become one of the best soldiers in the army.</p>

both, sir." "How can He be both?" "He is so great that the heaven of
heavens cannot contain Him, and so little that He can dwell in my

the cares and anxieties of life sit easy; provides us with a partner in
every affliction to alleviate the burthen, and is a sure resort against
every accident and difficulty that can happen.</p>

<h4>REAL AND ARTIFICIAL GENTLEMEN.</h4>

<p class="indent">A friend of mine, not long ago, coming over from Ireland, heard a man
asking, in reference to another, who he was. "I don't know," was the
reply; "but he's quite a gentleman. He always wears a tall hat." Indeed,
there are those who seem to be incapable of valuing their fellow-men by
anything except their clothes. A story is told of a Persian prince,
which well illustrates such worldliness. Dressed as a poor man, this
prince went to a feast. He was pushed here and there, could not get to
the table, and had soon to withdraw. On going home, he dressed himself
in his best, placing jewelled slippers on his feet, and putting on a
cloth-of-gold cloak. Then he returned to the feast, where matters were
immediately altered. The guests made room, and the host, rushing up,
cried, "Welcome, my lord! What will your lordship please to eat?" The
prince's answer was very expressive. Stretching out his foot, so that
his slipper sparkled and glittered, he took his golden robe in his hand,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a>[<a href="./images/151.png">151</a>]</span>and said with bitter irony, "Welcome, my lord coat! welcome, most
excellent robe! What will your lordship please to eat? For," said he,
turning to his surprised host, "I ought to ask my coat what it will eat,
since the welcome was solely to it."</p>

<h4>THE EDUCATION OF GIRLS.</h4>

<p class="indent">The Princess of Wales has decided views on the education of children.
Her Royal Highness, it appears, strongly objects to "cramming" children
with useless learning, which she declares is a mere waste of time.</p>

<p class="indent">The Princess considers it harmful to force a child in studies which are
distasteful to it, and that the child should <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a>[<a href="./images/154.png">154</a>]</span>be allowed to abandon that
study, and take up one it likes better.</p>

<p class="indent">Similarly, she disapproves of advanced arithmetic for girls. She
considers that all that most girls need ever know about arithmetic, is
addition and <ins class="corr" title="original has substraction">subtraction</ins>, "enough to know how to do their housekeeping
and pay their debts," she says.</p>

<h4>THE HOUR GLASS</h4>

<p class="indent">Is an emblem of human life. Behold! how swiftly the sands run, and how
rapidly our lives are drawing to a close! We cannot, without
astonishment, behold the little particles which are contained in this
machine; how they pass away almost imperceptibly! And yet, to our
surprise, in the short space of an hour, they are all exhausted. Thus
wastes man! To-day he puts forth the tender leaves of hope; to-morrow,
blossoms, and bears his blushing honors thick upon him; the next day
comes a frost, which nips the shoot; and when he thinks his greatness is
still aspiring, he falls, like autumn leaves, to enrich our mother
earth.</p>

the foliage of a boundless <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a>[<a href="./images/155.png">155</a>]</span>forest.<ins class="corr" title="quotation mark missing in original">"</ins> Yet even within this earth's narrow
limits, how vast the work of Providence! How soon is the mind lost in
contemplating it! How great that Being whose hand paints every flower,
and shapes every leaf; who forms every bud on every tree; who feeds each
crawling worm with a parent's care, and watches like a mother over the
insect that sleeps away the night in the bosom of a flower; who throws
open the golden gates of day, and draws around a sleeping world the
dusky curtains of the night; who measures out the drops of every shower,
the whirling snowflakes, and the sands of man's eventful life; who
determines alike the fall of a sparrow and the fate of a kingdom; and so
overrules the tide of human fortunes, that whatever befall him, come joy
or sorrow, the believer says&mdash;"It is the Lord; let Him do what seemeth
Him good."</p>

<p class="indent">"I know no duty in religion more generally agreed on, nor more justly
required by God Almighty, than a perfect submission to His will in all
things; nor do I think any disposition of mind can either please Him
more, or become us better, than that of being satisfied with all He
gives, and contented with all He takes away. None, I am sure, can be of
more honor to God, nor of more ease to ourselves. For, if we consider
Him as our Maker, we cannot contend with Him; if as our Father, we ought
not to distrust Him: so that we may be confident whatever He does is
intended for good; and whatever happens that we interpret otherwise, yet
we can get nothing by repining, nor save anything by resisting.</p>

<p class="indent">Submission is the only way of reasoning between a creature and its
Maker; and contentment in His will is the greatest duty we can pretend
to, and the best remedy we can apply to all our misfortunes."</p>

guilt, as a companion to the other; and at last he executed it. He went
to a neighboring prison, and there selected the most degraded and
repulsive man he could find. His body and eye were wasted; vice was
visible in his very face. But what was the artist's surprise when, on
questioning the man as to his history, he found that it was he who, as a
lovely boy, had kneeled for him as the model of Innocence! Evil habits
had gradually changed him, not only in heart and mind, but in face and
form.</p>

<h4>ELOQUENCE OF THE HANDS.</h4>

<p class="indent">The hands are, by the very instincts of humanity, raised in prayer;
clasped in affection; wrung in despair; pressed on the forehead when the
soul is "perplexed in the extreme;" drawn inward, to invite; thrust
forth objectively, to repel; the fingers point to indicate, and are
snapped in disdain; the palm is laid upon the heart, in invocation of
subdued feeling, and on the brow of the compassioned in benediction. The
expressive capacity of the hands was never more strikingly displayed
than in the orisons (prayer) of the deaf and dumb. Their teacher stood
with closed eyes, and addressing the <ins class="corr" title="original has Diety">Deity</ins> by those signs made with the
fingers which constitute a language for the speechless. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a>[<a href="./images/171.png">171</a>]</span>Around him were
grouped more than a hundred mutes, following with reverent glances every
motion. It was a visible, but not an audible, worship.</p>

<h4>THE MOST BEAUTIFUL HAND.</h4>

<p class="indent">A dispute arose among three ladies as to which had the most beautiful
hands. One sat by a stream, and dipped her hand into the water and held
it up; another plucked strawberries until the ends of her fingers were
pink; and a third gathered violets until her hands were fragrant. An
old, haggard woman, passing by, asked, "Who will give me a gift, for I
am poor?" all three denied her; but another who sat near, unwashed in
the stream, unstained with fruit, unadorned with flowers or perfume,
gave her a little gift, and satisfied the poor woman. Then the woman
asked them what was the subject of their dispute; and they told her, and
lifted up before her their beautiful hands. "Beautiful indeed!" she
exclaimed, as she saw them. But when they asked her which was the most
beautiful, she said: "It is not the hand that is washed clean in the
brook; it is not the hand that is coloured with crimson tints; it is not
the hand that is perfumed with fragrant flowers; but the hand that gives
to the poor, that is the most beautiful."</p>

<h4>A BROKEN HEART.</h4>

<p class="indent">Dr. Mitchell of Philadelphia, in lecturing to his pupils upon the
diseases of the heart, narrated an anecdote to prove that the expression
"broken heart" was not merely figurative. On one occasion, in the early
period of his life, he accompanied, as surgeon, a packet that sailed
from Liverpool to one of the American ports. The captain frequently
conversed with him respecting a lady who had promised to <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a>[<a href="./images/175.png">175</a>]</span>become his
bride on his return from that voyage. Upon this subject he evinced great
warmth of feeling, and showed Dr. Mitchell some costly jewels,
ornaments, etc., which he intended to present as bridal presents. On
reaching his destination, he was abruptly informed that the lady had
married some one else. Instantly the captain was observed to clap his
hand to his breast, and fall heavily to the ground. He was taken up, and
conveyed to his cabin on board the vessel. Dr. Mitchell was immediately
summoned; but, before he reached the poor captain, he was dead. A
postmortem examination revealed the cause of his unfortunate disease.
His heart was found literally torn in twain! The tremendous propulsion
of blood, consequent upon such a violent nervous shock, forced the
powerful muscle tissues asunder, and life was at an end. The heart was
broken.</p>

<h4>TRUE NATURE OF HOME.</h4>

<p class="indent">This is the true nature of home&mdash;it is the place of Peace; the shelter

<h4>GIVE GOOD MEASURE.</h4>

<p class="indent">When I was a young man, there lived in our neighborhood one who was
universally reported to be a very liberal man, and uncommonly upright in
his dealings. When he had any of the produce of his farm to dispose of,
he made it an invariable rule to give good measure, over good, rather
more than could be required of him. One of his friends, observing him
frequently doing so, questioned him why he did it, told him he gave too
much, and said it would not be to his own advantage. Now mark the answer
of this man. "God Almighty has permitted me but one journey through the
world; and when gone I cannot return to rectify mistakes."</p>

boys, Reuben and Sandy? The story was as follows: "On a cold winter day,
a gentleman in Edinburgh had, out of pity, bought a box of matches from
a poor, little, shivering boy, and, as he had no pence, had given him a
shilling, of which the change was to be brought to his hotel. Hours
passed by, and the boy did not return. Very late in the evening a mere
child came to the hotel. 'Are you the gentleman that bought the matches
frae Sandy?' 'Yes.' 'Well, then, here's fourpence out o' yer' shillin';
Sandy canna come. He's verra ill. A cart ran over him and knocked him
doon, and he lost his bonnet and his matches and yer sevenpence, and
baith his legs are broken, and the doctor says he'll dee; and that's
a'.' And then, putting down the fourpence on the table, the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a>[<a href="./images/192.png">192</a>]</span>poor child
burst into great sobs. 'So I fed the little man,' said the narrator;
'and I went with him to see Sandy. The two little things were living
almost alone; their father and mother were dead. Poor Sandy was lying on
a bundle of shavings. He knew me as soon as I came in, and said<ins class="corr" title="original has extraneous single quote">,</ins> 'I got
the change, sir, and was coming back, and then the cart knocked me down,
and both my legs were broken; and oh, Reuby, little Reuby, I am sure I
am dying, and who will take care of you when I am gone? What will ye
do?' 'I took his hand, and said I would always take care of Reuby. He

me; the light went out of his blue eyes. In a moment,</p>

the poor man told his story and produced his writings, but lacked
witnesses. The other, provided with witnesses, laid his whole stress on
them and on his adversary's defective law, who could produce none; he,
therefore, urged the cadi to give sentence in his favor. After the most
pressing solicitations, the judge calmly drew from beneath his sofa the
bag of five hundred ducats, which the rich man had given him as a bribe,
saying to him very gravely, "You have been much mistaken in the suit;
for if the poor man could produce no witnesses in confirmation of his
right, I, myself, can furnish him with at least five hundred." He threw
him the bag with reproach and indignation and decreed the house to the
poor plaintiff.</p>

<h4>WHAT A SONG DID.</h4>

<p class="indent">A Scottish youth learned, with a pious mother, to sing the old psalms
that were then as household words to them in the kirk (church) and by
the fireside. When he had grown up he wandered away from his native
country, was taken captive by the Turks, and made a slave in one of the
Barbary States. But he never forgot the songs of Zion, although he sang
them in a strange land and to heathen ears.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a>[<a href="./images/199.png">199</a>]</span>
One night he was solacing himself in this manner when the attention of
some sailors on board of a British man-of-war was directed to the
familiar tune of "Old Hundred" as it came floating over the moonlit
waves.</p>

<p class="indent">At once they surmised the truth that one of their countrymen was
languishing away his life as a captive. Quickly arming themselves, they
manned a boat and lost no time in effecting his release. What joy to him
after eighteen long years passed in slavery! Is it strange that he ever
afterwards cherished the glorious tune of "Old Hundred?"</p>

<h4>NO ONE SHOULD BE BLAMED FOR HIS INFIRMITIES.</h4>

<p class="indent">A hound, who in the days of his youth and strength had never yielded to
any beast of the forest, encountered in his old age a boar in the chase.
He seized him boldly by the ear, but could not retain his hold because
of the decay of his teeth, so that the boar escaped. His master, quickly
coming up, fiercely abused the dog. The hound looked up and said: "It
was not my fault, master; my spirit was as good as ever, but I could not
help mine infirmities. I rather deserve to be praised for what I have
been, than to be blamed for what I am."</p>

<h4>PERSONAL INFLUENCE.</h4>

<p class="indent">"On a cold winter evening," said Dr. T. L. Cuyler recently, "I made my
first call on a rich merchant in New York. As I left the door and the
piercing gale swept in, I said:</p>

<p class="indent">"What an awful night for the poor?</p>

<p class="indent">"He said come back for a moment; and in a very few minutes brought me a
roll of bank bills, and said:</p>

<p class="indent">"Please hand these for me to the poorest people you know.</p>

<p class="indent">"After a few days I wrote him the grateful thanks of the poor whom his
bounty had relieved, and added:</p>

<p class="indent">"How is it that a man so kind to his fellow creatures has always been so
unkind to his Saviour as to refuse him his heart?</p>

<p class="indent">"That sentence touched him to the core.</p>

<p class="indent">"He sent for me to come and talk to him, and speedily gave himself to
Christ. He has been a most useful Christian ever since. But he told me I
was the first person who had talked to him about his soul in twenty
years. One hour of work did more for that man than the pulpit effort of
a life-time."</p>

<h4>POLITICAL INTEGRITY.</h4>

for the service of the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a>[<a href="./images/209.png">209</a>]</span>public. With a view to bribe him, his old
school-fellow, the Lord Treasurer Danby, went to him in his garret. At
parting, the Lord Treasurer slipped into his hands an order upon the
treasury for &pound;1000, and then went into his chariot. Marvell looking at
the paper, called after the treasurer&mdash;"My lord, I request another
moment." They went up again to the garret, and the servant boy was
called&mdash;"What had I for dinner yesterday?" "Don't you remember, sir, you
had the little shoulder of mutton that you ordered me to bring from a
woman in the market?" "Very right. What have I for dinner today?" "Don't
you know, sir, that you made me lay up the blade-bone to broil?" "'Tis
so; very right. Go away." "My lord, do you hear that? Andrew Marvell's
dinner is provided; there's your piece of paper, I want it not. I knew
the sort of kindness you intended. I live here to serve my constituents.
The ministry may seek men for their purpose; I am not one."</p>

proportionally expensive; whereas a woman who brings none will be very
moderate in expenses. <i>Johnson</i>: "Depend upon it, Sir, this is not true.
A woman of fortune, being used to the handling of money, spends it

causes but in open court, where both parties were to be heard alike," so
he would not suffer him to go on. Whereupon his grace (for he was a
Duke) went away not a little dissatisfied, and complained of it to the
king, as a rudeness that was not to be endured. But his majesty bade him

<p>I send you herewith a bill for ten louis d'ors. I do not

shall return to your country you cannot fail of getting into
some business that will in time enable you to pay all your
debts. In that case, when you meet with another honest man in
similar distress you must pay me by lending this sum to him,
enjoining him to discharge the debt by a like operation when
he shall be able, and shall meet with such another
opportunity. I hope it may thus go through many hands before
it meets with a knave to stop its progress. This is a trick of

<h4>GRATITUDE OF AN INDIAN CHIEF.</h4>

<p class="indent">A Scotch Highlander was taken prisoner by a tribe of Indians; his life
was about to be sacrificed, when the chief adopted him as his son. They
carried him into the interior; he learnt their language, assumed their
habits, and became skillful in the use of their arms. After a season the
same tribe began their route to join the French army, at that time
opposed to the British. It was necessary to pass near to the British
lines during the night. Very early in the morning, and it was spring,
the old chief roused the young Highlander from his repose: he took him
to an eminence, and pointed out to him the tents of his countrymen. The
old man appeared to be dreadfully agitated, and there was a keen
restlessness in his eye. After a pause&mdash;"I lost," said he, "my only son
in a battle with your nation; are you the only son of your father? And
do you think that your father is yet alive?" The young man replied, "I
am the only son of my father, and I hope that my father is yet alive."
They stood close to a beautiful magnolia in full blossom. The prospect
was grand and enchanting, and all its charms were crowned by the <ins class="corr" title="original has sum">sun</ins>,
which had fully emerged from the horizon. The old chief, looking
steadfastly at his companion, exclaimed: "Let thy heart rejoice at the
beauty of the scene! To me it is as the desert; but you are free; return
to your countrymen, revisit your father that he may again rejoice when
he sees the sun rise in the morning, and the trees blossom in the
spring!"</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Returned Kindness.</i>&mdash;When the country near Albany was newly settled, an
Indian came to the inn at Lichfield, and asked for a night's shelter, at
the same time confessing that from failure in hunting he had nothing to
pay. The hostess drove him away with reproachful epithets, and as the
Indian was retiring sorrowfully,&mdash;there being no other inn for many a
weary mile,&mdash;a man who was sitting by directed the hostess to supply his
wants, and promised to pay her. As soon as his supper was ended, the
Indian thanked his benefactor, and said he would some day repay him.
Several years thereafter the settler was taken a prisoner by a hostile
tribe, and carried off to Canada. However, his life <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"></a>[<a href="./images/217.png">217</a>]</span>was spared, though
he himself was detained in slavery. But one day an Indian came to him,
and giving him a musket, bade the captive follow him. The Indian never
told where they were going, nor what was his object; but day after day
the captive followed his mysterious guide, till one afternoon they came
suddenly on a beautiful expanse of cultivated fields, with many houses

<h4>SCOTCH STUDENT AS LAMPLIGHTER.</h4>

<p class="indent">Many hardships endured by students attending university or college in
Scotland have been brought to light from time to time. A student of
Anderson's Medical College some years ago fulfilled the duties of
lamplighter during his spare <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"></a>[<a href="./images/223.png">223</a>]</span>hours in a neighboring burgh. He had no
other income than the few shillings he received weekly for lighting,
extinguishing and cleaning the burgh lamps, and from this he paid his
college fees and kept himself fairly respectable. On one occasion he
applied for an increase of wages, and was called before the committee.
One of the bailies remarked that an able-bodied healthy-looking young
man like the applicant, might find some other employment instead of
wasting his time as he was doing. The application for an increase was
refused. One may conceive the bailie's surprise at a subsequent meeting
when the town clerk read a letter from the lamplighter, tendering his
resignation, as he had passed his final examination as a fully qualified
doctor.</p>

<h4>ORIGIN OF LANGUAGE.</h4>

<p class="indent">Talking of the origin of language,&mdash;<i>Johnson</i>: "It must have come by
inspiration. A thousand, nay, a million of children could not invent a
language. While the organs are pliable, there is not understanding
enough to form a language; by the time that there is understanding
enough, the organs are become stiff. We know that after a certain age we
cannot learn to pronounce a new language. No foreigner who comes to
England when advanced in life, ever pronounces English tolerably well;
at least such instances are very rare. When I maintain that language
must have come by inspiration, I do not mean that inspiration is
required for rhetoric, and all the beauties of language; for when once
man has language, we can conceive that he may gradually form
modifications of it. I mean only that inspiration seems to me to be
necessary to give man the faculty of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a>[<a href="./images/224.png">224</a>]</span>speech; to inform him that he may
have speech; which I think he could no more find out without inspiration
than cows or hogs would think of such a faculty."</p>

<h4>GENERAL LEE'S REPLY.</h4>

<p class="indent">After the Civil War many offers of places of honor and fame came to

presidency of an insurance company, at a salary of fifty thousand
dollars a year. He declined it, saying that it was work with which he
was not familiar.</p>

<p class="indent">The following well-merited rebuke by a slave to his master, shows that
persons occupying mean positions in this life are sometimes superior to
those above them.</p>

<p class="indent">A gentleman in the enjoyment of wealth, and of high social standing, and
wholly given up to the pleasures of this world, knowing that one of his
slaves was religious, and happening to see him in the garden near the
porch of his house, called him up rather to amuse himself than for any
serious purpose. When the slave came to him, cap in hand, he said, "Tom,
what do you think of me; do you believe I will be one of the elect when
I die?"</p>

<p class="indent">With a low obeisance, the slave replied: "Master, I never knew any one
to be elected who was not a candidate."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233"></a>[<a href="./images/233.png">233</a>]</span>
The master, struck with the gentle but just rebuke of the man's answer,
turned and entered his mansion, and from that hour became a candidate,
living thereafter a good life.</p>

<h4>LOVE.</h4>

<p class="indent">To a man, the disappointment of love may occasion some bitter pangs: it
wounds some feelings of tenderness&mdash;it blasts some prospects of
felicity; but he is an active being; he may dissipate his thoughts in
the whirl of varied occupation, or may plunge into the tide of pleasure;
or, if the scene of disappointment be too full of painful associations,
he can shift his abode at will, and taking, as it were, the wings of the
morning, can "fly to the uttermost parts of the earth, and be at rest."</p>

<p class="indent">But woman's is comparatively a fixed, a secluded and a meditative life.
She is more the companion of her own thoughts and feelings; and if they
are turned to ministers of sorrow, where shall she look for consolation?
Her lot is to be wooed and won; and if unhappy in her love, her heart is
her world&mdash;is like some fortress that has been captured, and sacked, and
abandoned, and left desolate.</p>

<p class="indent">Shall I confess it?&mdash;I believe in broken hearts, and the possibility of
dying of disappointed love! I do not, however, consider it a malady
often fatal to my own sex; but I firmly believe that it withers down
many a lovely woman into an early grave. So is it the nature of woman to
hide from the world the pangs of wounded affection.</p>

<h4>MARTIN LUTHER AND HIS FRIENDS.</h4>

<p class="indent">"My dear Veit," said Luther, "I have said it often and I repeat it
again, whoever would know God aright and speculate concerning Him
without danger, must look into the manger, and learn first of all to
know the Son of the Virgin Mary, born at Bethlehem, lying in His
mother's bosom or hanging upon the cross; then will he understand who
God is. This will not only then be not terrible, but on the contrary
most attractive and comforting. Guard yourself, my dear Veit, from the
proud thought of climbing into heaven without this ladder, apart from
the Lord Jesus Christ in His humanity. As the Word simple describes Him,
stick to this, and do not permit reason to divert you from it; then will
you apprehend God aright! I wish to know of no other God than the God
who hung upon the cross, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, and of the Virgin
Mary."</p>

<h4>MAN.</h4>

<p class="indent">Man has been thrown naked into the world, feeble, incapable of flying
like the bird, running like the stag, or creeping like the serpent;
without means of defense, in the midst of terrible enemies armed with
claws and stings; without means to brave the inclemency of the seasons,
in the midst of animals protected by fleece, by scales, by furs; without
shelter, when all others have their den, their hole, their shell;
without arms, when all about him are armed against him. And yet he has
demanded of the lion his cave for a lodging and the lion retires before
his eyes; he has despoiled the bear of his skin, and of it made his
first clothing; he has plucked the horn from the bull, and this is his
first drinking-cup; then he has dug even into the bowels of the earth,
to seek there the instruments of his future strength; from a rib, a
sinew, and a reed, he has made arms; and the eagle, who, seeing him at
first in his weakness and nakedness, prepares to seize him as his prey,
struck in mid-air, falls dead at his feet, only to furnish a feather to
adorn his head. Among animals, is there one, who under such conditions
could have preserved life? Let us for a moment separate the workman from
his work, God from <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252"></a>[<a href="./images/252.png">252</a>]</span>nature. Nature has done all for this insect,&mdash;of
which they had been discoursing,&mdash;nothing for man. It is that man should
be the product of intelligence rather than of matter; and God, in
granting him this celestial gift, this ray of light from the divine
fire, created him feeble and unprotected, that he might make use of it,
that he might be constrained to find in himself the elements of his
greatness.</p>

suddenly brought to a halt by a small tree which intervened between the
front wheel and the body of his buggy. Seeing a servant at a short
distance, he asked him to bring an axe and cut down the tree. The
servant&mdash;a colored man&mdash;told the judge that there was no occasion for
cutting down the tree, but just to back the buggy. Pleased at the good
sense of the fellow, Judge Marshall told him that he would leave him
something at the inn hard by, where he intended to stop, having then no
small change. In due time the man applied, and a dollar was handed him.
Being asked if he knew who it was that gave him the dollar, he replied:
"No, sir: I concluded he was a gentleman by his leaving the money, but I
think he is the biggest fool I ever saw."</p>

others, in reference to marriages. One was, "Keep within the bounds of
your profession." The other was, "Look at suitableness in age, quality,
education, temper, etc." He used to observe, from Genesis, ii, 18, "I
will make him a help-meet for him;" that there is not meetness, there
will not be much help. He commonly said to his children, with reference
to their choice in marriage, "Please God, and please yourselves, and you
shall never displease me;" and greatly blamed those parents who conclude
matches for their children without their consent. He sometimes mentioned
the saying of a pious gentlewoman, who had many daughters.&mdash;"The care of
most people is how to get good husbands for their daughters; but my care
is to fit my daughters to be good wives, and then let God provide for
them."</p>

<h4>FRIENDS IN NEED.</h4>

<p class="indent">Perhaps one of the most noteworthy characteristics of Methodists is the
spirit of clannishness which runs through the whole body. Is any sick,
the rest are eager to pray; is any merry, the rest are delighted to sing
psalms; and they will not only pray and sing in sympathy, which is
comparatively easy, but they are ready to spend, and to be spent, for
the brethren to almost any extent. Men may know that they are Methodists
from the love they have one to another.</p>

<h4>WHILE MOTHER WAS AWAY.</h4>

<p class="indent">The Princess of Wales has trained her children so carefully in habits of
obedience and veracity that they are most trustworthy little persons.
Before her royal highness started on her trip round the world with her
husband, she drew up a list of rules to be observed in the nursery, and
added a series of light tasks to be fullfilled by each one of the
youngsters before the date set for her return.</p>

<p class="indent">The rules were to be enforced by the nurses. The performance of the
tasks was left to the honor of the children, and in addition there was a
list of things they must not do.</p>

<p class="indent">There were occasional lapses of memory as regards the forbidden things,
and some carelessness in carrying out the tasks, for royal children,
despite the severity of their training, are children still. But in the
main they respected their mother's wishes and commands, and took no
advantage of her absence. Upon one occasion, however, they were sorely
tempted. This was when their loving and beloved grandmother, Queen
Alexandria, brought them a big box of bonbons. But when the sweets were
offered to them, one child after another reluctantly but firmly declined
to take any.</p>

<p class="indent">"We like them, but mother has forbidden us to eat them," explained the
eldest prince.</p>

<p class="indent">"You can have the sugar-plums if I say you may," said the indulgent
queen. "I will tell mama all about it when she returns."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287"></a>[<a href="./images/287.png">287</a>]</span>
Prince Eddie wavered momentarily, then reiterated his refusal.</p>

<p class="indent">"We'd like them," he sighed, "but that's what mother said."</p>

<p class="indent">The queen was slightly annoyed by this opposition.</p>

<p class="indent">"But if I say you may&mdash;" she said.</p>

<p class="indent">Prince Eddie stood his ground, a hero between two fires&mdash;the wishes of
his adored mother, and those of his almost equally adored grandmother.
His sister and his brothers followed his lead. When the queen went away
she put the bonbons on the nursery table and there they stayed for
months untouched, a handsome monument to the thoroughness of the
princess' training and the respectful love and devotion of her children.</p>

<h4>THE DARING OF A MOTHER.</h4>

<p class="indent">In Scotland a peasant woman had a child a few weeks old, which was
seized by one of the golden eagles, the largest in the country, and
borne away in its talons to its lofty eyrie on one of the most
inaccessible cliffs of Scotland's bleak hills; the mother, perceiving
her loss, hurried in alarm to its rescue, and the peasantry among whom
the alarm spread, rushed out to her aid; they all came to the foot of
the tremendous precipice; the peasants were anxious to risk their lives
in order to recover the little infant; but how was the crag to be
reached? One peasant tried to climb, but was obliged to return; another
tried and came down injured; a third tried, and one after another
failed, till a universal feeling of despair and deep sorrow fell upon
the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288"></a>[<a href="./images/288.png">288</a>]</span>crowd as they gazed upon the eyrie where the infant lay. At last a
woman was seen, climbing first one part and then another, getting over
one rock and then another, and while every heart trembled with alarm, to
the amazement of all, they saw her reach the loftiest crag, and clasp
the infant rejoicingly in her bosom. This heroic female began to descend
the perilous steep with her child; moving from point to point; and while
everyone thought that her next step would precipitate her and dash her
to pieces, they saw her at length reach the ground with the child safe
in her arms. Who was this female? Why did she succeed when others
failed? It was The Mother of The Child.</p>

<h4>A MOTHER'S LOVE.</h4>

<p class="indent">Children, look in those eyes, listen to that dear voice, notice the
feeling of even a single touch that is bestowed upon you by that gentle
hand. Make much of it while yet you have that most precious of all good
gifts, a loving mother. Read the unfathomable love of those eyes; the
kind anxiety of that tone and look, however slight your pain.</p>

<p class="indent">In after-life you may have friends, fond, dear, kind friends; but never
will you have again the inexpressible love and gentleness lavished upon
you which none but a mother bestows. Often do I sigh in my struggles
with hard, uncaring world, for the sweet, deep security I felt when, of
an evening nestling in her bosom, I listened to some quiet tale,
suitable to my age, read in her tender and untiring voice. Never can I
forget her sweet glances cast upon me when I appeared asleep, never her
kiss of peace at night. Years have passed away since we laid her beside
my father in the old church yard; yet still her voice whispers from the
grave, and her eye watches over me, as I visit spots long since hallowed
to the memory of my mother.</p>

<p class="indent">Each mother is a historian; she writes not the history of empires or of
nations on paper, but she writes her own history on the imperishable
mind of her child. That tablet and that history will remain indelible
when time shall be no more. That history each mother shall meet again,
and read, with eternal joy, or unutterable grief, in the coming ages of
eternity.</p>

<h4>MOTHERS AND MEN.</h4>

<p class="indent">That it is the mother who moulds the man is a sentiment beautifully
illustrated by the following recorded observation of a shrewd writer:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"When I lived among the Choctaw Indians, I held a consultation with one
of their chiefs respecting the successive stages of their progress in
the arts of civilized life; and among other things he informed me, that
at their start they made a great mistake,&mdash;they only sent boys to
school. These boys came home intelligent men; but they married
uneducated and uncivilized wives, and the uniform result was, the
children were all like their mothers. The father soon lost all his
interest both in wife and children. 'And now,' said he 'if we would
educate but one class of our children, we should choose the girls; for,
when they become mothers, they educate their sons.'"</p>

<h4>A MOTHER'S EXAMPLE.</h4>

<p class="indent">It was a judicious resolution of a father, as well as a most pleasing
compliment to his wife, when, on being asked by a friend what he
intended to do with his girls, he replied: "I intend to apprentice them
to their mother, that they may learn the art of improving time, and be
fitted to become wives, mothers, heads of families, and useful members
of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292"></a>[<a href="./images/292.png">292</a>]</span>society." Equally just, but very different, was the remark of an
unhappy husband&mdash;his wife was vain and thoughtless&mdash;"It is hard to say,
but if my girls are to have a chance of growing up good for anything,
they must be sent out of the way of their mother's example."</p>

<h4>A CLEVER "TURN."</h4>

<p class="indent">Lord Elibank, the Scotch peer, was told that Dr. Johnson, in his
dictionary, had defined oats to be food for horses in England, and for
men in Scotland. "Ay," said his lordship, "and where else can you find
such horses and such men?"</p>

the justice of the remark. Without filial obedience everything must go
wrong. Is not a disobedient child guilty of a manifest breach of the
Fifth Commandment? And is not a parent, who suffers this disobedience to
continue, an habitual partaker in his child's offense against that
commandment?"</p>

<h4>SCOTTISH PERSEVERANCE.</h4>

<p class="indent">Scottish perseverance has itself become proverbial; we remember to have
met with a story which is said to be connected with the foundation of an
opulent mercantile house which has flourished for some generations.
Saunders, the traveler, entered a shop in London and enquired for the
head of the house; one of the clerks asked what he wanted; the answer of
Saunders was, as usual, a question, "Want ye aught in my line, sir?"
"No," was the prompt reply, accompanied by a look of contempt at the
itinerant Scotch merchant. "Will ye no tak' a look o' the gudes, sir?"
was Saunders' next query. "No, not at all; I have not time. Take them
away&mdash;take them away!" "Ye'll aiblins (perhaps) find them worth your
while, and I doubt na but ye'll buy," said Saunders; and he proceeded to
untie and unstrap his burden. "Go away&mdash;go away!" was reiterated more
than once by the clerk, but the persevering Scot still persisted. The
master of the establishment overheard all that had taken place, and now
he stepped forward, and, moved by some compunction for the treatment the
traveler had received, and some admiration, too, for the patience and
perseverance of the man, he consented to look over the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311"></a>[<a href="./images/311.png">311</a>]</span>contents of the
pack, found them to be exactly the goods he was in want of, purchased
them all, and gave a very large order; and thus, says Chambers, who
tells the story, assisted in the foundation of a large mercantile house.</p>

<p class="indent">But is not this the stuff of which also the Livingstones and the
Macleods are made? Was not this the spirit which set the brave Sir
Walter Scott to work, when sinking into his later years, to overtake his
fearful loss of one hundred thousand pounds? Is it not a commentary upon
that especial proverb which we have said so illustrates the Scottish
character, "He that tholes (or endures) overcomes?"</p>

<h4>NAME OF THE GOOD SAMARITAN.</h4>

<p class="indent">A philanthropist, when a candidate for the ministry, was traveling on
one occasion from Strasbourg. It was in the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312"></a>[<a href="./images/312.png">312</a>]</span>winter time. The ground was
deeply covered with snow, and the roads were almost impassable. He had
reached the middle of his journey and was among the mountains; and by
that time was so exhausted that he could stand erect no longer. He was
rapidly freezing to death, and sleep began to overpower him. He
commended himself to God, and yielded to what he felt to be the sleep of
death. He knew not how long he slept, but suddenly became conscious of
some one rousing him. Before him stood a wagon-driver in his blue
blouse, and the wagon not far away. His rescuer gave him a little wine
and food, and the spirit of life returned. He then helped him upon the
wagon, and brought him to the next village. Oberlin, the philanthropist,
was profuse in his thanks, and offered money, which his benefactor
refused. "It is only a duty to help one another," said the wagoner; "and
it is the next thing to an insult to offer a reward for such a service."
"Then," said Oberlin, "at least tell me your name, that I may have you
in thankful remembrance before God." "I see," said the wagoner, "that
you are a minister of the Gospel. Please tell me the name of the Good
Samaritan." "That," said Oberlin, "I cannot do; for it was not put on
record." "Then," replied the wagoner, "until you can tell me his name,
permit me to withhold mine."</p>

<p class="indent"><i>A Sensible Answer.</i>&mdash;A story is told about Wendell Phillips&mdash;a story
that must have made even the serious-minded Abolitionist laugh heartily:
He was in a hotel in Charleston, had breakfast in his room, and was
served by a slave. Mr. Phillips spoke to him as an Abolitionist, but the
waiter seemed to be more concerned about the breakfast than about
himself. Finally Mr. Phillips told him to go away, saying that he could
not bear to be waited upon by a slave.</p>

<h4>TRUE POLITENESS.</h4>

<p class="indent">The following beautiful incident is related of the late Prince consort.
On one occasion a humble but very worthy man who had befriended the
Prince in early life called to see him, and was invited to come to the
family table. He began to eat with his knife, as he had always been
accustomed <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316"></a>[<a href="./images/316.png">316</a>]</span>to do, and this excited a little quiet merriment among the
young people. Prince Albert looked round upon them, as if to say, "Stop
that!" and at once began himself to eat with his knife, and continued to
do so to the end of the meal. After dinner, one of the children asked
him why he did so. The Prince replied: "It is well enough for us to
observe the etiquette of the day; but it is far more important to avoid
insulting people. I wanted my old friend to enjoy his dinner, which he
could not have done had he seen you laughing at him. He is accustomed to
use his knife, and it would doubtless be quite difficult for him to use
the fork instead."&mdash;This was genuine politeness, and the world would be
happier if the same feeling were always shown.</p>

<p class="indent">"I never had a bad morning," replied the man. "That is very singular; I
wish you may always be as fortunate." "I was never unfortunate," said
he. "I hope you may always be as happy," said the divine. "I am never
unhappy," said the other. "I wish," said the divine, "that you would
explain yourself a little."</p>

<p class="indent">"That I will cheerfully do," said the other; "I said that I never had a
bad morning, for every morning, even if I am pinched with hunger, I
praise God. If it rains, or snows, or hails, whether the day is serene
or tempestuous, I am still thankful to God, and therefore I never had a
joyless morning. If I am miserable in outward circumstances, and
despised, I still praise God; you wished that I might always be
fortunate, but I cannot be unfortunate, because nothing befalls me but
according to the will of God, and I believe that His will is always
good, in whatever He does or permits to be done. You wished me always
happy, but I cannot be unhappy, because my will is always resigned to
the will of God."</p>

<p class="indent">The divine, astonished at the man's answers, asked him whence he came.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323"></a>[<a href="./images/323.png">323</a>]</span>

are you?" "I am a king." "Where is your kingdom?" "It is within my

better than to rule any kingdom in the world."</p>

<p class="indent">"How were you brought into this happy condition?"</p>

thus lost the rare chance to win both fame and fortune.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Profanity Gently Reproved.</i>&mdash;It is related that the excellent John
Wesley, having to travel some distance in a stagecoach, was thereby
brought into the company of an intelligent and gentlemanly officer of
the British army. The officer was very social with his traveling
companions; but the enjoyment, which his society would otherwise have
afforded to those with him, was sadly lessened by the profane
expressions he used.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337"></a>[<a href="./images/337.png">337</a>]</span>
While stopping at a station, Mr. Wesley called the officer to one side,
and, after expressing the satisfaction he had enjoyed in his company,
told him he felt encouraged to ask of him a very great favor. "I shall
take great pleasure in obliging you," replied the officer, "as I am
certain you would not make an unreasonable request."&mdash;"Then," said Mr.
Wesley, "as we are to travel together for some days, I beg that if I
should so far forget myself as to use any profane language, you will
kindly reprove me." The officer immediately perceived how faithfully and
how delicately his own conduct stood reproved, and, smiling, said, "No
one but Mr. Wesley could administer reproof in such manner."</p>

<h4>RUSKIN MEETS SOME TOURISTS.</h4>

<p class="indent">"I was fated the other day to come from Venice to Verona with a
family&mdash;father and mother and two girls&mdash;it matters not what country
they came from&mdash;presumably rich&mdash;girls fifteen and eighteen. I never
before conceived the misery of people who had evidently spent all their
lives in trying to gratify themselves. It was a little warm&mdash;warmer than
was entirely luxurious&mdash;but nothing in the least harmful. They moaned
and fidgeted and frowned and puffed and stretched and fanned, and ate
lemons, and smelled bottles, and covered their faces, and tore the cover
off again, and had not one thought or feeling during five hours of
traveling in the most noble part of all the world except what four poor
beasts would have had in their end of a menagerie, being dragged about
on a hot day. Add to this misery every form of polite vulgarity, in
methods of doing and saying the common things they said and did. I never
yet saw humanity so degraded (allowing for external circumstances of
every possible advantage) given wealth, attainable education and the
inheritance of eighteen centuries of Christianity.<ins class="corr" title="quotation mark missing in original">"</ins></p>

<p class="indent"><i>The Influence of Riches.</i>&mdash;A respectable widow lady, with a very small
income, which she was obliged to eke out by the produce of her own
industry and ingenuity, was remarkable for her generous liberality,
especially in contributing to the cause of religion. When any work of
pious benevolence <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341"></a>[<a href="./images/341.png">341</a>]</span>was going forward, she was always ready to offer a
donation equal to those of persons in comparative affluence. In process
of time this lady came into the possession of an ample fortune, greatly
to the joy of all who knew her willing liberality. But she no longer
came forward unsolicited towards the cause of Christ, and when applied
to, she yielded her aid but coldly and grudgingly, and sometimes excused
herself from giving at all. On one occasion she presented a shilling to
the same cause to which she had formerly given a guinea when in a state
of comparative poverty. Her minister felt it his duty to expostulate
with her, and reminded her of her former generosity when her means were
so circumscribed. "Ah! sir," she affectingly replied; "then I had the
shilling means, but the guinea heart, now I have the guinea means, but
only the shilling heart. Then I received day by day my daily bread, and
I had enough and to spare; now, I have to look at my ample income, but I
live in constant apprehension that I may come to want!"</p>

<h4>OPULENCE.</h4>

<p class="indent">Every one who rightly considers it, may know, that eminence and opulence
in the world are not real divine blessings, notwithstanding man, from
the pleasure he finds in them, calls them so; for they pass away, and
also seduce many, and turn them away from heaven; but that eternal life,
and its happiness, are real blessings, which are from the Divine: this
the Lord also teaches in Luke: 12 ch., 33-34. "Make to yourselves a
treasure that faileth not in the heavens, where the thief cometh not,
nor the moth corrupteth; for where your treasure is, there will your
heart be also."</p>

<p class="indent">When Henry Drummond was traveling in tropical Africa, he found that salt
was regarded by the natives as a rare luxury. Often he offered the

they always chose the salt. Once he presented the head man of a village
with a spoonful of salt. The chief twisted a leaf into a little bag,
into which he poured the salt. Then he held out his hand to the children
who crowded around, and each was allowed one lick of his empty palm.</p>

<h4>EARLY TRIALS OF DISTINGUISHED SCHOLARS.</h4>

<p class="indent">It is related of Dr. Adam, the celebrated rector of the High School of
Edinburgh, that when at college he had to be content with a penny roll
for his dinner. Similar, though more severe, were the early trials of
Samuel Drew, also of Edinburgh. At the age of ten he was apprenticed to
a shoemaker, a calling which he continued to follow long after he had
become celebrated as an author. For days and days together in his early
life he was too poor to spend even a penny for his dinner; and he was
accustomed, when dinner-time came, to tie his apron-string tighter to
lessen the pang of hunger, and go on with his work till evening. Through
years of hardship and drudgery his courage never forsook him; amidst
ceaseless labor he strove unremittingly to improve his mind, studying
astronomy, history, and metaphysics; and finally, from the humblest
circumstances, he rose to occupy a conspicuous place as an author, a
philosopher, and a metaphysician.</p>

<p class="indent">The life of Balzac too, the French author, whose brilliant abilities won
for him at last such wealth, fame and influence in France, is a type of
many a literary career. At the age of twenty his wealthy parents wished
to make him a notary. He announced his determination to become an
author. "But" urged the father, "do you not know to what state <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348"></a>[<a href="./images/348.png">348</a>]</span>the
occupation of a writer will lead you? In literature a man must be either
king or a hodman." "Very well," replied Balzac, "I will be king!" The
family left town; the youth was left to his fate in a garret, with the
magnificent allowance of twenty-five francs a month. The first ten years
he fought with poverty and all its evils; the second decade made him his

<h4>CONCEIT OF SELF REBUKED.</h4>

<p class="indent">"When I was younger than I am now," says a lawyer who is still somewhat
this side of middle age, "I had a position in the office of a man who
has a big reputation. Naturally, I felt my responsibility. It was plain
to me that the head of the firm had outlived his usefulness, and I used
to feel sorry to think what would happen to him if I ever left him.
Sheer magnanimity made me overlook a lot of things.</p>

<p class="indent">"I wasn't treated in that office with all the deference due me, but I
stood it till one day somebody went too far. Then I marched into the old
gentleman's private office and laid down the law to him. I told him I
wasn't going to endure such treatment another day. I was going to quit,
that was what I was going to do, and I was going to quit right then and
there. I unburdened my mind freely, and then I stopped to give him a
chance to apologize and beg me not to ruin him by leaving. He didn't
look up from his desk. He said to me in a polite kind of way, 'Please
don't slam the door when you go out<ins class="corr" title="period missing in original">.</ins>'"</p>

become a distinguished minister, and afterwards a celebrated professor,
author of the "Self-Interpreting Bible," and many other works. Robert
Turnbull said of him in one of his books:&mdash;"When a poor shepherd boy, he
conceived the idea of learning Latin and Greek, and having procured a
few old books, actually accomplished the task, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357"></a>[<a href="./images/357.png">357</a>]</span>while tending his cattle
on the hills. So successful was he that some of the old and
superstitious people in the neighborhood concluded that he must have
been assisted by 'the evil spirit.' On one occasion he went to
Edinburgh, plaided and barefoot, walked into a bookseller's shop, and
asked for a Greek Testament. 'What are you going to do with a Greek
Testament?' said the bookseller. 'Read it,' was the prompt reply. 'Read
it!' exclaimed the sceptical bookseller with a smile; 'ye may have it
for nothing if ye'll read it.' Taking the book, he quietly read off a
few verses, and gave the translation; on which he was permitted to carry
off the Greek Testament in triumph."</p>

<h4>SLANDER AND EVIL SPEAKING.</h4>

<p class="indent">A lady who had been in the habit of spreading slanderous reports once
confessed her fault to St. Philip Neri, who lived several hundred years
ago. She asked him how she could cure it. "Go," he said in reply, "to
the nearest market-place, buy a chicken just killed, pluck its feathers
all the way, and come back to me." She was greatly surprised, wondering
in what way a dead chicken could help her overcome her evil habit; but
she did as he bade her, and came back to him with the plucked chicken in
her hand. "Now go back," he said, "and bring me all the feathers you
have scattered." "But this is impossible," she replied: "I cast the
feathers carelessly, and the wind carried them away; how can I recover
them?" "That," he said, "is exactly like your words of slander. They
have been carried about in every direction. You cannot recall them. Go
and slander no more." It was a striking way of teaching a very important
lesson.</p>

<h4>A RESTFUL PREACHER.</h4>

<p class="indent">Dean Ramsey relates that the Earl of Lauderdale was alarmingly ill, one
distressing symptom being a total absence of sleep, without which the
medical men declared he could not recover. His son, who was somewhat
simple, was seated under the table, and cried out, "Sen' for that
preaching man frae Livingstone, for fayther aye sleeps in the kirk." One
of the doctors thought the hint worth attending to, and the experiment
of "getting a minister till him" succeeded, for sleep came on and the
earl recovered.</p>

about which she had been thinking. "You remember what I said?" the lady
inquired, and the philosopher replied that he did. "Well," added the
lady, "I was only joking." "You remember what I asked?" said Smith.
"Yes" replied the lady. "Well," said Smith, "I was only joking too."</p>

<h4>STORY OF A STANZA.</h4>

<p class="indent">Many years ago Dr. Valpy, a well known English scholar, wrote a little
verse of four lines as the longing of his heart and the confession of
his faith. This was the simple stanza:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"In peace let me resign my breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And Thy salvation see;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My sins deserve eternal death,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But Jesus died for me."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">Some time afterwards he gave this verse to his friend Dr. Marsh, and it
became a great blessing to him. Dr. Marsh read the lines to his friend
Lord Roden, who was so impressed with them that he got the doctor to
write them out, and then fastened the paper over the mantlepiece in his
study, and there, yellow with age, they hung for many years.</p>

character of a large majority of plays put on the stage.</p>

<p class="indent">Listen to what the play-writers and actors themselves say:</p>

the theatre; it is not merely the work that is immoral, it is the
place."</p>

<p class="indent">W. C. Macready, the great actor, said: "None of my children shall ever,
with my consent, enter a theatre, or have any visiting connection with
actors or actresses."</p>

<p class="indent">Edwin Booth, the great tragedian, wrote: "My knowledge of the modern
theatre is so very meagre that I never permit my wife or daughter to
witness a play without previously ascertaining its character. The
theatre is permitted to be a mere shop for gain, open to every huckster
of immoral adventures,&mdash;jimcracks."</p>

<p class="indent">Fanny Kemble, the actress, confessed that life on the stage was
unhealthy to morals, and said: "I never presented myself before an
audience without a shirking feeling of reluctance, or without thinking
the excitement I had undergone unhealthy, and the personal exhibition
odious."</p>

<p class="indent">At a dinner when Daniel Webster was Secretary of State, after a period
of silence which fell upon the company of some twenty gentlemen who were
present, one of the guests said, "Mr. Webster, will you tell us what was
the most important thought that ever occupied your mind?" Webster slowly
passed his hand over his forehead, and in a low tone enquired of one
near him, "Is there any one here who does not know me?" "No; all are
your friends." "The most important thought that ever occupied my mind,"
said Webster, "was that of my individual responsibility to God." And
after speaking on this subject in the most solemn strain for fully ten
minutes, he silently rose from the table and retired to his room. This
incident serves to illustrate the attitude of great minds towards
eternal things. Great men are not scoffers. The men of flippant jeers
and godless jests are invariably men of small calibre and shallow
intellect.</p>

<h4>ONE WAY OF ACQUIRING A TITLE.</h4>

<p class="indent">"From time immemorial," said Judge Asher Carruth, of London, "Southern
people have been lavish in bestowing <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386"></a>[<a href="./images/386.png">386</a>]</span>titles. I think there is something
in the Southern temperament which explains this. I didn't start out on
this, however, for a philosophical disquisition, but rather to tell how
a certain Kentucky gentleman established valid title to the rank of
Colonel. He went to Cincinnati once with a friend, who enjoyed many
acquaintances there; and who introduced him to every one as Colonel
Brown. Everything went along smoothly until finally one Cincinnatian
asked of the introducer:</p>

<p class="indent">"I suppose your friend Colonel Brown was in the Confederate army?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No, sir; he was not."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, then, he fought on the Union side?"</p>

<p class="indent">"You are wrong there, too<ins class="corr" title="original has comma">.</ins>"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, I see now; he got his title by serving in the State militia?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No, he never entered the militia."</p>

<p class="indent">"Then, how did he get to be a colonel?"</p>

<p class="indent">"He drew a sword, sir, at a church fair!"</p>

<h4>INFLUENCES OF FOREIGN TRAVEL.</h4>

<p class="indent">One of the remarks which an American is expected to make on returning
from a foreign tour, especially his first return, is: "Well I'm a better
American for having gone abroad," meaning that foreign travel has
increased his love for his own country&mdash;in other words, has toned up his
patriotism.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class="indent">Foreign travel will make any intelligent American a better citizen,
because an increase of knowledge is a betterment. One honored resident
of Washington, a gentleman past middle life, recently returned from his
first European tour, and on being asked if he could make the stereotyped
report of having been "made a better American," replied: "Yes; I think I
am a better American for having had a deal of conceit knocked out of
me." That was a profitable experience.</p>

they were sometimes greatly distressed for food, which led the women and
the children to the sea side to look for a ship which they expected with
provisions, but no ship appeared for many weeks; they saw in the sand,
however, vast quantities of shellfish, since called clams, a species of
muscle. Hunger impelled them to taste, and at length they fed wholly
upon them, and were as cheerful and well as they had been before in
England, enjoying the best provision. It is added, that a good man,
after they had all dined one day on clams, without bread, returned
thanks to God for causing them to "suck of the abundance of the seas,
and of treasures hid in the sand." This text, which they had never
before observed particularly, was ever after endeared to them.</p>

Mr. George Herbert, the poet, when walking to Salisbury, saw a poor
man, with a poorer horse, fallen under his load. Mr. Herbert perceiving
this, put off his canonical coat, and helped the poor man to unload, and
after to load his horse. The poor man blessed him for it, and he blessed
the poor man, and gave him money to refresh both himself and his horse;
and told him, "If he loved himself, he should be merciful to his beast."
At his coming to his musical friends at Salisbury, they began to wonder
that Mr. George Herbert, who used to be so clean, came in such a
condition; but he told them the occasion; and when one of the company
told him, "he had disparaged himself by so dirty an employment," his
answer was, "That the thought of what he had done would prove music to
him at midnight; and the omission of it would have upbraided and made
discord in his conscience, whensoever he should pass by the place."</p>

<p class="indent">During the Rabbi's absence from home, two of his sons died. Their mother
hiding her grief, awaited the father's return, and then said to him. "My

to-day, and I delivered them into His hands." "That is right," said the
Rabbi approvingly. "We must always return cheerfully and faithfully all
that is placed in our care." Shortly after this, the Rabbi asked for his
sons, and the mother, taking him by the hand, led him gently to the
chamber of death. Meir gazed upon his sons, and realizing the truth,
wept bitterly. "Weep not, beloved husband," said his noble wife; "didst
thou not say to me we must return cheerfully, when called for, all that
has been placed under our care? God gave us these jewels; He left them
with us for a time, and we gloried in their possession; but now that He
calls for His own, we should not repine."</p>

distant city, where he was to begin life and earn his livelihood. Before
parting with him, his mother gave him forty gold dinars, which, for
safety, she sewed inside his waistcoat. Her last counsel to him was, to
seek and to follow always the truth. On his way he had to cross part of
a desert, infested by robbers. One of these saw him and came galloping
up "Boy, what money have you got?" he sternly demanded. The boy looked
up at him, and said, "I have forty gold dinars sewed up in my
waistcoat." The robber burst into a fit of laughter; he thought the boy
was joking. And, turning his horse, he galloped back to his troop.
By-and-by, another horseman rode up to the boy as he trudged on, and
made the same demand: "Boy, what have you got?" "Forty gold dinars,
sewed up in my waistcoat," said the boy again. This robber, too, burst
out laughing, and turned away, thinking the boy was making fun of him.
They had some talk in their band about the boy's strange reply. Their
leader turning it over in his mind, said he would like to see him, and,
leaving the troop, soon overtook the young traveler. He put the same
question <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396"></a>[<a href="./images/396.png">396</a>]</span>as the others, and again the boy gave the same answer. The
captain leapt off his horse, and began to feel the boy's clothes, till
he counted&mdash;one, two, three&mdash;the forty gold dinars just as he had been
told. "What made you tell the truth, my boy?" he asked. "My God and my
mother, sir," was the reply. "Wait for me here a little," said the
captain, and galloped back to his troop. In a few minutes he returned,
but so changed that the boy hardly knew him. By removing a false beard
and other disguises, his appearance was quite altered. "Come with me, my
lad," he said; and he pointed to the spires of a distant city. "I cannot
go with you," said the boy; "you are a robber!" "I was," the man said,
"but all that is over now! I have given it up forever. I have a large
business in yonder city, and I wish you to come with me and share it."
And so they went on together; and when they arrived at the city the boy
entered his employment, and ultimately became very wealthy and
influential.</p>

<h4>A TOUCHING SCENE AT SEA.</h4>

<p class="indent">Two weeks ago on board an English steamer, a little ragged boy, aged
nine years, was discovered on the fourth day of the voyage out from
Liverpool to New York, and carried before the first mate, whose duty it
was to deal with such cases. When questioned as to his object of being
stowed away, and who brought him on board, the boy, who had a beautiful
sunny face, and eyes that looked like the very mirrors of truth, replied
that his step-father did it, because he could not afford to keep him,
nor pay his passage out to Halifax, where he had an aunt who was well
off, and to whose house he was going. The mate did not believe the
story, in spite of the winning face and truthful accents of the boy. He
had seen too much of stow-aways to be easily deceived by them, he said;
and it was his firm conviction that the boy had been brought on board
and provided with food by the sailors. The little fellow was very
roughly handled in consequence. Day by day he was questioned and
re-questioned, but always with the same result. He did not know a sailor
on board, and his father alone had secreted him and given him the food
which he ate. At last the mate, wearied by the boy's persistence in the
same story, and perhaps a little anxious to inculpate the sailors,
seized him one day by the collar, and, dragging him to the fore, told
him that unless he would tell the truth in ten minutes from that time,
he would hang him from the yard-arm. He then made him sit down under it
on the deck. All around him were the passengers and sailors of the
midway watch, and in front of him stood the inexorable mate, with his
chronometer in his hand, and the other officers of the ship by his side.
It was the finest sight, said our informant, that he ever beheld&mdash;to see
the pale, proud, sorrowful face of that noble boy, his head erect, his
beautiful blue eyes bright through <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398"></a>[<a href="./images/398.png">398</a>]</span>the tears that suffused them. When
eight minutes had fled, the mate told him he had but two minutes to
live, and advised him to speak the truth and save his life; but he
replied with the utmost simplicity and sincerity by asking the mate if
he might pray. The mate said nothing, but nodded his head and turned
deadly pale, and shook with trembling like a reed with the wind, and
there, all eyes turned on him, the brave and noble little fellow, this
poor waif, whom society owned not, and whose own step-father could not
care for him&mdash;there he knelt, with clasped hands, and eyes turned to
heaven, while he repeated audibly the Lord's prayer, and prayed the Lord
Jesus to take him to heaven. Sobs broke from strong, hard hearts, as the
mate sprang forward to the boy, and clasped him to his bosom, and kissed
him and blessed him, and told him how sincerely he believed his story,
and how glad he was that he had been brave enough to face death and be
willing to sacrifice his life for the truth of his word.</p>

<h4>REWARD OF TRUTHFULNESS.</h4>

<p class="indent">When Aristotle, the Grecian philosopher, who was tutor to Alexander the
Great, was asked what a man could gain by uttering falsehoods, he
replied, "Not to be credited when he shall tell the truth." On the other
hand, it is related that when Petrarch, the Italian poet, a man of
strict integrity, was summoned as a witness, and offered in the usual
manner to take an oath before a court of justice, the judge closed the
book, saying, "As to you, Petrarch, your <i>word</i> is sufficient."</p>

<h4>SPEAK GENTLY.</h4>

<p class="indent">"Please buy my penny songs!" cried a feeble voice in one of the streets
of a great city. The day was very cold, and little Katie had left her
cheerless home to earn, if possible, a few pennies. Poor Katie! Her
little voice was feeble because her heart was sad, for so many passed
her by unnoticed; and she felt almost discouraged.</p>

<p class="indent">Soon she found herself in a music store, standing near a beautiful lady,
who was sitting there selecting music. She again uttered her little cry,
"Please buy a penny song!" but the lady, not hearing what she said,
turned towards her, and, with the kindest, sweetest smile, said gently,
"What is it, darling?" at the same time putting a piece of money <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400"></a>[<a href="./images/400.png">400</a>]</span>in her
hand. Katie, not thinking what she did, laid her head in the lady's lap,
and cried as though her heart would break. The lady tried to soothe her;
and soon Katie said, "O lady! I cry, not because you gave money, but
because you spoke so kindly to me."</p>

<h4>A BEAUTIFUL CHERRY TREE.</h4>

<p class="indent">When George Washington was a boy, a beautiful cherry tree was killed in
his father's garden, by some violent hand stripping its bark. Mr.

he would like to know <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404"></a>[<a href="./images/404.png">404</a>]</span>the offender. Shortly after, seeing George with
an axe in his hand, he asked him if he knew who had killed the cherry
tree. George hesitated for a moment, then said, "I cannot tell a lie,
father, I cannot tell a lie. I cut it with the hatchet." "Come to my
arms<ins class="corr" title="comma missing in original">,</ins>" said his father; "you have paid for it a thousand times." Such an
act of heroism in telling the truth he valued more than a thousand
cherry trees.</p>

<h4>A RECOMMENDATION.</h4>

<p class="indent">The following verses were sent to a graduate of Wheaton Seminary of the
class of 1866 by John G. Whittier, on the receipt of two pairs of long
stockings, which the young woman had knit. She was a frequent visitor in
the Whittier home, and often assisted in the entertainment of guests of
honor. Mr. Whittier regarded the verses as doggerel, and expressed his
intention of writing something worth while for his youthful admirer. But
the poem reveals a humorous side of his character, differing from what
one finds in his published poetry, and it is probable that neither Mr.
Whittier nor his young friend, who died in her early womanhood, would
have objected to the publication of the verses.</p>

the house will return, when the heat and burden of the day are past; do
not let him at such time, find upon his coming to his habitation, that
the foot which should hasten to meet him is wandering at a distance,
that when he is weary with toil and jaded with discouragement, the soft
hand which should wipe the sweat from his brow, is knocking at the door
of other houses.</p>

<h4>THE WIFE.</h4>

<p class="indent">I have often had occasion to remark the fortitude with which women
sustain the most overwhelming reverses of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410"></a>[<a href="./images/410.png">410</a>]</span>fortune. Those disasters
which break down the spirit of a man, and prostrate him in the dust,
seem to call forth all the energies of the softer sex, and give such
intrepidity and elevation to their character, that at times it
approaches to sublimity. Nothing can be more touching, than to behold a
soft and tender female, who had been all weakness and dependence, and
alive to every trivial roughness, while threading the prosperous paths
of life, suddenly rising in mental force to be the comforter and
supporter of her husband under misfortune and abiding with unshrinking
firmness, the bitterest blasts of adversity.</p>

<p class="indent">As the vine which has long twined its graceful foliage about the oak,
and been lifted by it into sunshine, will, when the hardy plant is
rifted by the thunder-bolt, cling round it with its caressing tendrils,
and bind up its shattered boughs; so it is beautifully ordered by
Providence, that woman who is the mere dependent and ornament of man in
his happier hours, should be his stay and solace when smitten with
calamity; winding herself into the rugged recesses of his nature,
tenderly supporting the drooping head, and binding up the broken heart.</p>

<p class="indent">I was once congratulating a friend, who had around him a blooming
family, knit together in the strongest affection. "I can wish you no
better lot," said he, with enthusiasm, "than to have a wife and
children. If you are prosperous, there they are to share your
prosperity; if otherwise, there they are to comfort you." And, indeed, I
have observed that a married man, falling into misfortune, is more apt
to retrieve his situation in the world than a single one; partly because
he is more stimulated to exertion by the necessities of the helpless and
beloved beings who depend upon him for subsistence; but chiefly because
his spirits are soothed and relieved by domestic endearments, and his
self-respect kept alive by finding, that though all abroad is darkness
and humiliation, yet there is still a little world of love at home, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411"></a>[<a href="./images/411.png">411</a>]</span>of
which he is the monarch. Whereas, a single man is apt to run to waste
and self-neglect; to fancy himself lonely and abandoned, and his heart
to fall to ruin, like some deserted mansion, for want of an inhabitant.</p>

<p class="indent">These observations call to mind a little domestic story, of which I was
once a witness. My intimate friend, Leslie, had married a beautiful and
accomplished girl, who had been brought up in the midst of fashionable
life. She had, it is true, no fortune, but that of my friend was ample;
and he delighted in the anticipation of indulging her in elegant
pursuit, and administering to those delicate tastes and fancies that
spread a kind of witchery about the sex.&mdash;"Her life," said he, "shall be
like a fairy tale."</p>

<p class="indent">The very difference in their characters produced a harmonious
combination; he was of a romantic and somewhat serious cast; she was all
life and gladness. I have often noticed the mute rapture with which he
would gaze upon her in company, of which her sprightly powers made her
the delight; and how, in the midst of applause, her eye would still turn
to him, as if there alone she sought favor and acceptance. When leaning
on his arm, her slender form contrasted finely with his tall, manly
person. The fond confiding air with which she looked up to him seemed to
call forth a flush of triumphant pride and cherishing tenderness, as if
he doted on his lovely burden for its very helplessness. Never did a
couple set forward on a flowery path of early and well-suited marriage
with a fairer prospect of felicity.</p>

<p class="indent">It was the misfortune of my friend, however, to have embarked his
property in large speculations; and he had not been married many months
when, by a succession of sudden disasters, it was swept from him, and he
found himself reduced to almost penury. For a time he kept his situation
to himself, and went about with a haggard countenance and a breaking
heart. His life was but a protracted agony; and what rendered it more
insupportable was the necessity of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412"></a>[<a href="./images/412.png">412</a>]</span>keeping up a smile in the presence
of his wife; for he could not bring himself to overwhelm her with the
news. She saw, however, with the quick eyes of affection, that all was
not well with him. She marked his altered looks and stifled sighs, and
was not to be deceived by his sickly and vapid attempts at cheerfulness.
She tasked all her sprightly powers and tender blandishments to win him
back to happiness; but she only drove the arrow deeper into his soul.
The more he saw cause to love her, the more torturing was the thought
that he was soon to make her wretched. A little while, thought he, and
the smile will banish from that cheek&mdash;the song will die away from those
lips&mdash;the lustre of those eyes will be quenched with sorrow&mdash;and the
happy heart which now beats lightly in that bosom will be weighed down,
like mine, by the cares and miseries of the world.</p>

<p class="indent">At length he came to me one day, and related his whole situation in a
tone of the deepest despair. When I had heard him through, I inquired,
"Does your wife know all this?" At the question he burst into an agony
of tears. "For God's sake!" cried he, "if you have any pity on me, don't
mention my wife; it is the thought of her that drives me almost to
distraction!"</p>

<p class="indent">"And why not?" said I:&mdash;"She must know it sooner or later: you cannot
keep it long from her, and the intelligence may break upon her in a more
startling manner than if imparted by yourself; for the accents of those
we love soften the harshest tidings. Besides, you are depriving yourself
of the comforts of her sympathy; and not merely that, but also
endangering the only bond that can keep hearts together&mdash;an unreserved
community of thought and feeling. She will soon perceive that something
is secretly preying upon your mind; and true love will not brook
reserve: it feels undervalued and outraged, when even the sorrows of
those it loves are concealed from it."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413"></a>[<a href="./images/413.png">413</a>]</span>
"Oh, but my friend! to think what a blow I am to give to all her future
prospects&mdash;how I am to strike her very soul to the earth, by telling her
that her husband is a beggar!&mdash;that she is to forego all the elegancies
of life&mdash;all the pleasures of society&mdash;to shrink with me into indigence
and obscurity! To tell her that I have dragged her down from the sphere
in which she might have continued to move in constant brightness&mdash;the
light of every eye&mdash;the admiration of every heart!&mdash;How can she bear
poverty? She has been brought up in all the refinements of opulence
*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*"</p>

<p class="indent">I saw his grief was eloquent, and I let it have its flow; for sorrow
relieves itself by words. When his paroxysm had subsided, and he had
relapsed into moody silence, I resumed the subject gently, and urged him
to break his situation at once to his wife. He shook his head
mournfully, but positively.</p>

<p class="indent">"But how are you to keep it from her? It is necessary she should know
it, that you may take the steps proper to the alteration of your
circumstances. You must change your style of living&mdash;nay," observing a
pang to pass across his countenance, "don't let that afflict you. I am
sure you never placed your happiness in outward show&mdash;you have yet
friends, warm friends, who will not think the worse of you for being
less splendidly lodged; and surely it does not require a palace to be
happy with Mary&mdash;" "I could be happy with her," cried he convulsively,
"in a hovel! *"</p>

<p class="indent">"Believe me, my friend," said I, stepping up, and grasping him warmly by
the hand, "she can be the same with you. Ay, more: it will be a source
of pride and triumph to her&mdash;it will call forth all the latent energies
and fervent sympathies of her nature; for she will rejoice to prove that
she loves you for yourself. There is in every true woman's heart a spark
of heavenly fire, which lies dormant in the broad daylight of
prosperity; but which kindles up, and beams and blazes in the dark hour
of adversity." I finished <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414"></a>[<a href="./images/414.png">414</a>]</span>by persuading him to go home and unburden his
sad heart to his wife.</p>

<p class="indent">I must confess, notwithstanding all I have said, I felt some little
solicitude for the result. Who can calculate on the fortitude of one
whose whole life has been a round of pleasures? Her gay spirits might
revolt at the dark downward path of low humility, suddenly pointed out
before her, and might cling to the sunny regions in which they had
hitherto reveled.</p>

<p class="indent">In short, I could not meet Leslie next morning without trepidation. He
had made the disclosure.</p>

<p class="indent">"And how did she bear it?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Like an Angel! It seemed rather to be a relief to her mind, for she
threw her arms around my neck, and asked if this was all that had lately
made me unhappy."</p>

<p class="indent">Some days afterwards, he called upon me in the evening. He had disposed
of his dwelling-house, and taken a small cottage in the country, a few
miles from town. He had been busy all day in sending out furniture. The
new establishment required few articles, and those of the simplest kind.
All the splendid furniture of his late residence had been sold,
excepting his wife's harp. That, he said was too closely associated with
the idea of herself; it belonged to the little story of their loves; for
some of the sweetest moments of their courtship were those when he had
leaned over that instrument, and listened to the melting tones of her
voice. I could not but smile at this instance of romantic gallantry in a
doting husband.</p>

<p class="indent">He was now going out to the cottage, where his wife had been all day
superintending its arrangement. My feelings had become strongly
interested in the progress of this family story, and as it was a fine
evening, I offered to accompany him.</p>

<p class="indent">He was wearied with the fatigues of the day, and as we walked out, fell
into a fit of gloomy musing.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415"></a>[<a href="./images/415.png">415</a>]</span>
"Poor Mary!" at length broke, with a heavy sigh, from his lips.</p>

<p class="indent">"And what of her," asked I, "has anything happened to her?"</p>

<p class="indent">"What," said he, darting an impatient glance, "is it nothing to be
reduced to this paltry situation&mdash;to be caged in a miserable cottage&mdash;to
be obliged to toil almost in the menial concerns of her wretched
habitation?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Has she then repined at the change?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Repined! she has been nothing but sweetness and good humor. Indeed, she
seems in better spirits than I have ever known her; she has been to me
all love and tenderness and comfort!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Admirable girl!" exclaimed I, "You call yourself poor, my friend; you
never were so rich&mdash;you never knew the boundless treasures of excellence
you possessed in that woman."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh! but, my friend, if this first meeting at the cottage were over, I
think I could then be comfortable. But this is her first day of real
experience: she has been introduced into an humble dwelling&mdash;she has
been employed all day, in arranging its miserable equipments&mdash;she has
for the first time known the fatigues of domestic employment&mdash;she has
for the first time looked around her on a home destitute of everything
elegant&mdash;almost of everything convenient; and may now be sitting down,
exhausted and spiritless, brooding over a prospect of future poverty."</p>

<p class="indent">There was a degree of probability in this picture that I could not
gainsay, so we walked on in silence.</p>

<p class="indent">After turning from the main road, up a narrow lane, so thickly shaded by
forest trees as to give it a complete air of seclusion, we came in sight
of the cottage. It was humble enough in its appearance for the most
pastoral poet; and yet it had a most pleasing rural look. *&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;* Just
as we approached we heard the sound of music&mdash;Leslie <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416"></a>[<a href="./images/416.png">416</a>]</span>grasped my arm; we
paused and listened. It was Mary's voice singing, in a style of the most
touching simplicity, a little Scotch air of which her husband was
peculiarly fond.</p>

<p class="indent">I felt Leslie's hand tremble on my arm. He stepped forward to hear more
distinctly. His step made a noise on the gravel walk. A bright beautiful
face glanced out at the window and vanished&mdash;a light footstep was
heard&mdash;and Mary came tripping forth to meet us. She was in a pretty
rural dress of white; a few wild flowers were twisted in her fine hair;
a fresh bloom was on her cheek; her whole countenance beamed with
smiles&mdash;I had never seen her look so lovely.</p>

<p class="indent">"My dear George," cried she, "I am so glad you are come; I have been
watching and watching for you; and running down the lane and looking out
for you. I've set out a table under a beautiful tree behind the cottage;
and I've been gathering some of the most delicious strawberries, for I
know you are so fond of them&mdash;and we have such excellent cream&mdash;and
everything is so sweet and still here.&mdash;Oh!" said she, putting her arm
within his, and looking up brightly in his face, "Oh, we shall be so
happy!"</p>

<p class="indent">Poor Leslie was overcome. He caught her to his bosom&mdash;he folded his arms
around her&mdash;he kissed her again and again&mdash;he could not speak for the
tears gushed into his eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">He has often assured me that though the world has since gone
prosperously with him, and his life has indeed been a happy one, yet
never has he experienced a moment of more exquisite felicity than the
time when I accompanied him to the little cottage in the country.</p>

<h4>AN ILL-TEMPERED LETTER.</h4>

<p class="indent">An ill-tempered letter, once sent, will sometimes embitter a life-time.
We once saw an old gentleman, with a wise, fine head, calm face, and a
most benevolent look, beg of a postmaster to return him a letter which
he had dropped into the box. To do so, as everybody knows, is illegal;
but won over by the old gentleman's importunity, the postmaster
complied, upon full proof, in comparing the writing etc. being given.
Then, with a beaming face, the old gentleman tore the letter into
fragments, and, scattering them to the winds, exclaimed&mdash;"Ah! I've
preserved my friend." The fact is, he had written a letter in a state of
irritation, which was probably unjust and hurtful, but which he had
wisely recalled. "Written words remain," <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428"></a>[<a href="./images/428.png">428</a>]</span>is not only a proverb, but a
very grave caution; and hence the advice&mdash;never write in anger, or, at
any rate, keep your letter till next morning, when you probably will be
cool and in a better frame of mind.</p>

<h4>IMPORTANCE OF ATTENDING PUBLIC WORSHIP.</h4>

<p class="indent">Said the Rev. W. J. Dawson: "I know in my own heart how soon the spirit
of devoutness fades when from any cause I am deprived of public worship
for any length of time. And when I see a youth to whom religious worship
has been the atmosphere of his childhood, gradually withdrawing himself
from the means of grace, I tremble for him, because I have seen what
that means. I can think of men whom I loved, and who now lead wretched

<h4>HANDWRITING&mdash;NATIONALITY OF.</h4>

<p class="indent">It is a remarkable fact, that no man can ever get rid of the style of
handwriting peculiar to his country. If he be English, he always writes
in English style; if French, in French style; if German, Italian, or
Spanish, in the style peculiar to his nation. Professor B&mdash;&mdash;
states:&mdash;"I am acquainted with a Frenchman, who has passed all his life
in England, who speaks English like one of our own countrymen, and
writes it with ten times the correctness of ninety-nine in a hundred of
us; but yet who cannot, for the life of him, imitate our mode of
writing. I knew a Scotch youth, who was educated entirely in France, and
resided eighteen years in that country, mixing exclusively with French
people, but who, although he had a French writing-master, and, perhaps,
never saw anything but French writing in his life, or rarely, yet wrote
exactly in the Scotch style.<ins class="corr" title="quotation mark missing in original">"</ins></p>
